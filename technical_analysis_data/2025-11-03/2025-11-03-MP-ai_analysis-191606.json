  "analysis": "Okay, here's a comprehensive technical analysis for MP based on the provided data.\n\n**1. MARKET BIAS: Neutral with a slight Bullish lean (60% confidence)**\n\nWhile the daily change is significantly negative (-8.61%) and there are more bearish than bullish signals detected overall (5 vs 4), the overwhelming strength of the oversold conditions indicated by the RSI, Stochastic, and Williams %R indicators cannot be ignored.  The extreme oversold RSI (10.0, signals ranked 85/100 and 80/100) suggests a potential for a significant bounce. However, the high volatility and undefined trend strength (ADX is NaN) warrant caution. The \"Wide Range Day\" signal (8.8% range) highlights the increased risk and potential for whipsaw price action. The low MFI (22.0) suggests money is leaving the stock, but it also aligns with the oversold narrative, potentially setting up for a reversal.\n\n**2. TOP TRADE SETUP: Aggressive Counter-Trend Long (Oversold Bounce)**\n\n*   **Entry Price:** $57.70 (Slightly above the current price to confirm some positive momentum).\n*   **Stop Loss:** $54.90 (Below recent lows, offering a buffer against further downside).\n*   **Target 1:** $60.00 (First area of prior resistance; a conservative target).\n*   **Target 2:** $62.00 (Next resistance level; potential for profit-taking).\n*   **Risk/Reward Ratio (Target 1):** Approximately 0.8 : 1 (Risking $2.80 to make $2.30).\n*   **Risk/Reward Ratio (Target 2):** Approximately 1.5 : 1 (Risking $2.80 to make $4.30).\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   This setup is aggressive due to the strong negative momentum and undefined trend.\n*   The risk/reward for Target 1 is below 1:1, which is not ideal, but reflects the uncertainty.\n\n**3. KEY LEVELS TO WATCH:**\n\n*   **Support Levels:**\n    *   $57.00 (Psychological level, near current price).\n    *   $56.00 (Recent intraday low).\n    *   $55.00 (Stronger historical support level).\n*   **Resistance Levels:**\n    *   $60.00 (Prior low and psychological resistance).\n    *   $62.00 (Recent swing high resistance).\n    *   $65.00 (Stronger resistance level).\n*   **Breakout/Breakdown Zones:**\n    *   **Breakdown:** Sustained break below $56.00 would likely invalidate the bullish bounce scenario and target lower levels.\n    *   **Breakout:** A sustained break above $62.00 with increasing volume would confirm a stronger reversal.\n\n**4. RISK FACTORS:**\n\n*   **Invalidation:**\n    *   A break below $54.90 (stop loss) would invalidate the setup, indicating further downside momentum.\n    *   If the price fails to bounce significantly after hitting oversold levels, this indicates continued bearish strength.\n*   **Key Risks:**\n    *   **High Volatility:** The volatility is extremely high (114.6%), increasing the risk of whipsaws and stop-loss hunting.\n    *   **Undefined Trend:** The ADX is NaN, meaning the trend strength is unclear, which makes it difficult to asses whether this is a true reversal or simply a relief bounce.\n    *   **Continued Bearish Momentum:**  The market may continue its downward trajectory despite oversold indicators, particularly if negative news emerges or market sentiment worsens. The MACD (-4.0183) is still firmly negative, indicating continued bearish momentum.\n    *   **Volume:** If the bounce is not accompanied by a significant increase in volume, it could be a false signal.\n\n**5. TIMEFRAME RECOMMENDATION:**\n\n*   **Best Timeframe:** Intraday charts (15-minute to 1-hour). These timeframes allow for closer monitoring of price action and volume for confirmation of the bounce.\n*   **Expected Hold Time:** Short-term (1-3 days).  This is a counter-trend trade, and the goal is to capitalize on the initial bounce.\n\n**6. ACTION PLAN:**\n\n*   **WAIT & OBSERVE:**  Crucially, do NOT immediately buy.  The aggressive entry price of $57.70 requires some confirmation of upward momentum.\n*   **Conditions to Watch For:**\n    *   **Volume Confirmation:**  Look for a significant increase in buying volume at the $57.00 - $58.00 level.\n    *   **Price Action:**  Monitor the price action for bullish candlestick patterns (e.g., hammer, engulfing pattern) on the intraday charts.\n    *   **RSI Divergence:** Check for bullish divergence between the price and RSI on the intraday charts. If price makes a lower low but RSI makes a higher low, it can signal a potential reversal.\n*   **Buy/Sell/Wait:**\n    *   **WAIT** until you see the above conditions.\n    *   **BUY** only if you see the confirmation signals above.  Enter at $57.70 or slightly higher.\n    *   **Sell (Close position):** if the price hits either Target 1 or Target 2, or if the price breaks below the stop loss at $54.90.\n\n**Disclaimer:** This analysis is based solely on the provided data and should not be considered financial advice.
