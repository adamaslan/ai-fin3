  "analysis": "Okay, let's break down the technical situation for MP.\n\n**1. STRONGEST SIGNAL:**\n\n*   **`PRICE_ACTION - LARGE LOSS` (-8.6% today).** This is the most actionable because it represents significant and recent downward momentum. While oversold conditions are present, the magnitude of today's loss indicates strong selling pressure that is difficult to ignore. It highlights a fundamental shift in sentiment, regardless of potential short-term bounces.\n\n**2. OVERALL BIAS:**\n\n*   **Bearish - Confidence: High (8/10)**. While numerous oversold indicators are flashing, the sheer weight of bearish signals, including strong downtrend confirmation, weak momentum, price action (large loss, lower low, strong bearish candle), and being below the Ichimoku cloud, overwhelms the potential for a sustainable bullish reversal *at this moment*. The conflicting Ichimoku Cloud signals (one bullish, one bearish) suggest uncertainty in that indicator. The fact that the stock is still well above its 200 SMA but extended from it is a longer-term consideration that doesn't alleviate the immediate bearish pressure.\n\n**3. KEY LEVELS:**\n\n*   **Support:** Identify recent swing lows on a chart. Look for levels near previous support zones. Without a chart, it's impossible to provide precise figures. Watch for potential support around psychological levels like $55, $50, and $45.\n*   **Resistance:** Near the 10, 20, and 50 SMAs which currently act as dynamic resistance. Monitor today's high as initial resistance, then yesterday's close price.\n\n**4. RISK ASSESSMENT:**\n\n*   **Downside Risk:** Further price decline is highly probable, given the momentum. The volatility is extremely high, which means the stock could experience erratic price swings and potentially gap down further. Holding a long position carries significant risk of continued losses.\n*   **Upside Risk (for Short Sellers):** Oversold conditions could lead to a short-term bounce or \"dead cat bounce,\" squeezing short positions. A broader market rally could also lift MP despite its internal weaknesses.\n\n**5. TRADING RECOMMENDATION:**\n\n*   **Wait / Cautiously Short:**  Do not buy at these levels. The oversold signals are tempting, but the strong downtrend suggests further downside.\n    *   **Wait:** The best course of action is to wait for a confirmed bottom or signs of stabilization before considering a long position. Look for a period of consolidation and decreasing volatility.\n    *   **Cautiously Short:** If you have a high risk tolerance and understand short selling, *consider a small, highly controlled short position*.\n        *   **Entry:** Look for a pullback towards the 10 or 20 SMA as a potential short entry point.\n        *   **Stop Loss:** Place a tight stop-loss order just above a recent swing high or the 20 SMA to protect against a short squeeze.\n        *   **Target:** Aim for the next significant support level. Be prepared to take profits quickly, given the high volatility.\n    *   **AVOID LEVERAGE.** This stock is far too volatile for anything beyond a small, cash-account based position.\n\n**6. TIMEFRAME:**\n\n*   **Short-Term (Days to Weeks):** This analysis is primarily focused on the short-term due to the oversold conditions and price momentum. The large loss today and extreme volatility require quick reaction. Monitor intraday charts for potential reversal signals. However, be aware that the long-term trend is still up (above 200 SMA), which requires extra caution for short trades. You need to monitor this stock closely in a short timeframe to successfully navigate this volatility.\n",
