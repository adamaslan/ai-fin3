ALL SIGNALS (Ranked by AI Score):
================================================================================

#1 🔥 SCORE: 85/100
Signal: RSI EXTREME OVERSOLD
Description: RSI at 10.0
Category: RSI | Strength: STRONG BULLISH
AI Analysis: Extreme oversold RSI strengthens the bullish case. While a strong reversal is possible, the extremely high volatility adds considerable risk, but also potential reward. Timing could be good for a contrarian play.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#2 🔥 SCORE: 80/100
Signal: RSI OVERSOLD
Description: RSI at 10.0
Category: RSI | Strength: BULLISH
AI Analysis: RSI at 10 is extremely oversold, suggesting a potential bounce. Actionable for a short-term long position, but needs confirmation. High volatility increases risk.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#3 ⚡ SCORE: 75/100
Signal: STOCH OVERSOLD
Description: K: 1.3
Category: STOCHASTIC | Strength: BULLISH
AI Analysis: Stochastic oscillator in oversold territory supports the bullish reversal case. K value of 1.3 strengthens the oversold signal. Good timing but needs volume confirmation.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#4 ⚡ SCORE: 70/100
Signal: WILLIAMS OVERSOLD
Description: W%R: -98.7
Category: WILLIAMS | Strength: BULLISH
AI Analysis: Williams %R also confirms oversold conditions, adding weight to the potential reversal. Similar considerations to RSI and Stochastic, but slightly less reliable historically.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#5 📊 SCORE: 50/100
Signal: WIDE RANGE DAY
Description: Range: 8.8%
Category: PRICE_ACTION | Strength: VOLATILE
AI Analysis: Wide range day confirms high volatility and indecision in the market. It is hard to act on this signal alone, but it underlines the need for caution and tight stop-loss orders. Can create opportunity but also increases the chance of stop-loss hunting.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#6 📊 SCORE: 45/100
Signal: HIGH VOLATILITY
Description: 115% annualized
Category: VOLATILITY | Strength: CAUTION
AI Analysis: High volatility makes trading inherently riskier. This signal is a reminder to reduce position sizes and use wider stop losses. Also opens the potential for greater profit if the trade goes the correct way.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#7 📊 SCORE: 40/100
Signal: LOWER LOW
Description: Breaking below yesterday
Category: PRICE_ACTION | Strength: BEARISH
AI Analysis: Lower low reinforces the bearish trend. This signal on its own is not actionable, but adds bearish pressure and reduces the probability of a sustained bounce based purely on oversold indicators.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#8 ⚠️ SCORE: 35/100
Signal: STRONG BEARISH CANDLE
Description: Large body, small wicks
Category: PRICE_ACTION | Strength: BEARISH
AI Analysis: Strong bearish candle supports the short-term bearish outlook. While oversold, a strong bearish candle suggests the selling pressure is still dominant. Best to avoid counter-trend positions until the candle formations changes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#9 ⚠️ SCORE: 30/100
Signal: OBV FALLING
Description: Selling pressure increasing
Category: VOLUME | Strength: BEARISH
AI Analysis: Falling OBV confirms the selling pressure and weakens the bullish RSI signals. Not a strong signal on its own, but acts as a warning sign against aggressive long positions. Suggests the current downtrend may have further to run.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#10 ⚠️ SCORE: 30/100
Signal: EXTREME VOLATILITY
Description: 115% annualized
Category: VOLATILITY | Strength: HIGH RISK
AI Analysis: Extreme volatility makes precision trading difficult. Expect large swings and potential for false breakouts. Trade with caution and only if you are comfortable with the increased risk profile.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#11 ⚠️ SCORE: 20/100
Signal: LARGE LOSS
Description: -8.6% today
Category: PRICE_ACTION | Strength: STRONG BEARISH
AI Analysis: Large loss indicates strong bearish momentum. While oversold conditions exist, this signal suggests a continuation of the downtrend. High risk to counter-trade this.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#12 ⚠️ SCORE: 15/100
Signal: WEAK 20D MOMENTUM
Description: -22.4% in 20 days
Category: MOMENTUM | Strength: STRONG BEARISH
AI Analysis: Weak 20-day momentum indicates a sustained downtrend. This is a strong bearish signal and suggests the bounce will be weak, if any. Counter-trend trades are extremely risky in this scenario.
