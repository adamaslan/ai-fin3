================================================================================

Okay, let's analyze RGTI based on the provided technical data.

**1. STRONGEST SIGNAL:**

The **Strongest Signal** is the confluence of **"LARGE LOSS - -6.6% today"** combined with the **"RSI BEARISH DIVERGENCE"** and **"MACD BEAR CROSS / MACD MOMENTUM DOWN / MACD WEAK MOMENTUM".** This indicates a likely shift in momentum and a potential short-term correction. While the ADX indicates a strong trend, the sharp price drop coupled with bearish divergences in momentum oscillators often precedes pullbacks.

**2. OVERALL BIAS:**

**Short-Term Bearish Bias with Moderate Confidence.** While the long-term trend remains bullish based on moving averages and Ichimoku cloud, the recent price action and momentum signals suggest a pullback is probable. The extreme volatility makes the current situation highly risky for new entries.

**3. KEY LEVELS:**

*   **Support 1:** $40.50 (previous low, psychological level)
*   **Support 2:** $36.00 (20-day SMA)
*   **Resistance 1:** $46.40 (yesterday's high)
*   **Resistance 2:** $48.00 (recent peak)

**4. RISK ASSESSMENT:**

*   **High Volatility:** The extreme volatility (146.8%) increases the risk of sudden price swings and whipsaws.
*   **Potential Pullback:** The bearish signals suggest a potential pullback, which could erase recent gains.
*   **Overbought Conditions:** The price is significantly extended from the 200-day SMA, increasing the risk of mean reversion.
*   **False Signals:** In such a volatile market, momentum indicators are more likely to give off false signals, especially divergences, so confirmation is necessary before taking action.

**5. TRADING RECOMMENDATION:**

**RECOMMENDATION: WAIT/REDUCE.**

*   **Current Holders:** Consider reducing exposure or tightening stop-loss orders to protect profits. A stop-loss order near $40.50 could be prudent.
*   **New Entries:** Avoid new long positions at this time. Wait for a clearer signal of support or a significant pullback to the 20-day SMA (~$36.00) before considering entry.

**Entry/Exit Strategy (If Bullish Signal Confirmed):**

*   **Entry:** If price retraces to the $36 level and shows signs of support (e.g., bullish candlestick patterns, RSI bouncing off oversold territory), consider a long entry.
*   **Target 1:** $46.40 (yesterday's high)
*   **Target 2:** $48.00 (recent peak)
*   **Stop-Loss:** Place a stop-loss order just below the support level where you entered (e.g., if you entered at $36, place a stop-loss just below $36.)

**Entry/Exit Strategy (If Bearish Signal Confirmed):**

*   **Entry:** Look for a short entry around $43-$43.31, confirm with another drop and price action.
*   **Target 1:** $40.50 (previous low, psychological level)
*   **Target 2:** $36.00 (20-day SMA)
*   **Stop-Loss:** Place a stop-loss order just above the entry point, for example, at $44.00.

**6. TIMEFRAME:**

**Short-Term to Medium-Term (Days to Weeks):** This analysis is primarily focused on the short-term pullback potential. Long-term investors may remain bullish, but should be aware of short-term volatility.
