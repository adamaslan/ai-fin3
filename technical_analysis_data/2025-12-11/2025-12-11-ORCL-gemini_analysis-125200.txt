================================================================================

Okay, here's a technical analysis of ORCL based on the provided data:

**1. STRONGEST SIGNAL:**

*   **[VOLUME] VOLUME SELLOFF - High volume + price down (STRONG BEARISH):** This is the strongest actionable signal. A -12.95% price drop combined with a volume spike of 61,282,304 indicates significant selling pressure and conviction behind the downward move. This implies that a large number of investors are exiting their positions, further contributing to the downward momentum.

**2. OVERALL BIAS:**

*   **Strongly Bearish (Confidence: 90%)** The preponderance of bearish signals, especially those related to price action, volume, and trend, overwhelmingly suggests a continuation of the downtrend. While some bullish divergence signals exist, they are currently overshadowed by the strength of the bearish indicators.

**3. KEY LEVELS:**

*   **Resistance:** $210 (psychological level and prior support), $215 (20 SMA), $220 (50 SMA).
*   **Support:** We need to find more historic support, as we are seeing a large drop. Potential areas for support would include $180 (previous lows) and $170 (psychological level).

**4. RISK ASSESSMENT:**

*   **Downside Risk:** Further price decline due to strong selling pressure. The high volatility could lead to rapid and significant losses.
*   **Upside Risk:** The bullish divergences *could* signal a potential short-term bounce. However, relying solely on these divergences against a backdrop of strong bearish signals is very risky. A short squeeze is possible but unlikely given the overwhelming negative sentiment.
*   **Volatility Risk:** The 64.2% volatility increases the potential for both gains and losses, emphasizing the need for tight risk management.

**5. TRADING RECOMMENDATION:**

*   **Sell/Short:** Given the strong bearish signals, a short position is the most appropriate action.

    *   **Entry:** Enter a short position at the current price of $194.13, or on a slight bounce to potentially improve the entry price.
    *   **Stop Loss:** Place a stop-loss order above a recent high, such as $200. This would limit potential losses if the price unexpectedly reverses.
    *   **Target:** Aim for a price target near the next support level of $180 and $170. Adjust the target lower if the bearish momentum continues.
*   **Alternative Recommendation:** If unable to short, trim existing long positions and wait for further clarification.

**6. TIMEFRAME:**

*   **Short-Term to Medium-Term:** The analysis is best suited for a short-term to medium-term outlook (days to weeks). The extreme bearish signals suggest immediate downside pressure, but longer-term investors should monitor for potential bottoming patterns as the price approaches support levels.
