ALL SIGNALS (Ranked by AI Score):
================================================================================

#1 🔥 SCORE: 80/100
Signal: MA ALIGNMENT BULLISH
Description: 10 > 20 > 50 SMA
Category: MA_TREND | Strength: STRONG BULLISH
AI Analysis: MA alignment (10 > 20 > 50 SMA) is a strong bullish signal. It indicates a well-established uptrend. Reliable, but not actionable on its own due to overbought readings elsewhere.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#2 ⚡ SCORE: 75/100
Signal: STRONG UPTREND CONFIRMED
Description: +DI > -DI with high ADX
Category: TREND | Strength: BULLISH
AI Analysis: Strong uptrend confirmed by +DI > -DI with high ADX. This is a robust bullish signal, suggesting the uptrend is likely to continue, although a pullback may occur. Limited actionability on its own.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#3 ⚡ SCORE: 70/100
Signal: STRONG UPTREND
Description: ADX: 34.4
Category: TREND | Strength: TRENDING
AI Analysis: ADX indicates a strong uptrend. Reliable, but it doesn't tell us about potential pullbacks. High timing but no action without a entry point.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#4 ⚡ SCORE: 70/100
Signal: ABOVE 200 SMA
Description: Long-term uptrend
Category: MA_TREND | Strength: BULLISH
AI Analysis: Price above the 200 SMA confirms the long-term uptrend. Reliable, but offers limited short-term actionability due to the time frame. Shows that any pullbacks are likely to be bought.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#5 ⚡ SCORE: 65/100
Signal: PRICE AT 10 MA
Description: Price within 1% of 10 MA ($265.59)
Category: MA_PROXIMITY | Strength: WATCH
AI Analysis: Price near 10 MA indicates potential support or resistance. Actionable but not a strong signal on its own. Context is needed from other indicators. Could provide an entry point if other signals align.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#6 ⚡ SCORE: 65/100
Signal: CLOUD BULLISH
Description: Senkou A above B
Category: ICHIMOKU | Strength: BULLISH
AI Analysis: Senkou A above Senkou B (Ichimoku bullish cloud) further supports the bullish sentiment. Again, it can be late. Confirmation.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#7 ⚡ SCORE: 60/100
Signal: MACD FULLY BULLISH
Description: Both lines above zero
Category: MACD | Strength: BULLISH
AI Analysis: MACD fully bullish suggests continued upward momentum, but the RSI suggests caution. Reliability is fair, but the signal is already somewhat priced in. Use in conjunction with other bullish signs.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#8 ⚡ SCORE: 60/100
Signal: MOMENTUM BUILDING
Description: Consecutive positive momentum
Category: MOMENTUM | Strength: BULLISH
AI Analysis: Consecutive positive momentum suggests continued bullishness. Needs to be confirmed by ADX to determine the uptrend strength. Low action without knowing how the momentum is measured.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#9 ⚡ SCORE: 60/100
Signal: ABOVE CLOUD
Description: Ichimoku bullish
Category: ICHIMOKU | Strength: BULLISH
AI Analysis: Price above the Ichimoku cloud is a bullish sign, but can be late. Reliability fair. Use in conjunction with other bullish indicators.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#10 📊 SCORE: 55/100
Signal: MACD MOMENTUM DOWN
Description: Histogram expanding bearish
Category: MACD | Strength: BEARISH
AI Analysis: Histogram expanding bearish is a decent bearish signal, but its reliability varies. Good confirmation to overbought signals. The 'momentum down' signal provides early warning, but needs volume confirmation.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#11 📊 SCORE: 50/100
Signal: STOCH BEAR CROSS
Description: K crossed below D
Category: STOCHASTIC | Strength: BEARISH
AI Analysis: Stochastic bear cross provides bearish confirmation. Actionable, but the reliability can be low without other confirming signals. Could be a decent early sign of reversal.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#12 📊 SCORE: 45/100
Signal: STOCH OVERBOUGHT
Description: K: 85.0
Category: STOCHASTIC | Strength: BEARISH
AI Analysis: Stochastic oscillator in overbought territory is a bearish indicator. Moderately reliable, but can be a false signal in a strong uptrend. This is one more signal for bearish reversal.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#13 📊 SCORE: 40/100
Signal: MACD SIGNAL RISING
Description: Signal line trending upward
Category: MACD | Strength: BULLISH
AI Analysis: Rising signal line provides limited bullish signal. Signal line lagging behind price. Low actionability. Weak.

Signal: WILLIAMS OVERBOUGHT
Description: W%R: -15.0
Category: WILLIAMS | Strength: BEARISH
AI Analysis: Williams %R in overbought territory supports the bearish view. Good confirmation of reversal. Limited actionability on its own.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#15 ⚠️ SCORE: 30/100
Signal: RSI EXTREME OVERBOUGHT
Description: RSI at 84.4
Category: RSI | Strength: STRONG BEARISH
AI Analysis: Extreme overbought RSI reinforces the likelihood of a pullback or consolidation. Risk/reward skews negative. Needs confirmation from other bearish signals to be highly actionable. Limited reliability without confirmation.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#16 ⚠️ SCORE: 25/100
Signal: RSI OVERBOUGHT
Description: RSI at 84.4
Category: RSI | Strength: BEARISH
AI Analysis: RSI at 84.4 is significantly overbought, suggesting a pullback is likely. However, overbought conditions can persist in strong uptrends. Actionability is moderate, but timing might be premature.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#17 ⚠️ SCORE: 20/100
Signal: LOW VOLUME
Description: Below average activity
Category: VOLUME | Strength: WEAK
AI Analysis: Below average volume can indicate a weakening trend or a lack of conviction. Low actionability and reliability. This alone is weak.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#18 ⚠️ SCORE: 20/100
Signal: EXTENDED FROM 200 SMA
Description: 45.2% above
Category: MA_TREND | Strength: OVERBOUGHT
AI Analysis: Price extended 45.2% above the 200 SMA suggests overextension. This points to a high probability of a pullback or consolidation. Risk/reward is heavily skewed to the downside in the short term. Poor timing to initiate new long position
