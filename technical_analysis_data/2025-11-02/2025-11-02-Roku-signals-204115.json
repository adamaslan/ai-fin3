      "ai_score": 95,
      "ai_reasoning": "High volume combined with a price increase signals a strong breakout, indicating continued upward momentum. Highly actionable, reliable, excellent timing, and great risk/reward. It's a very compelling signal. The best signal overall.",

      "ai_score": 90,
      "ai_reasoning": "Extreme volume of 3x the average confirms significant buying pressure and validates the price movement. Highly actionable, reliable, excellent timing, and good risk/reward. This signal is very strong. This is a key signal alongside the bull cross.",

      "ai_score": 88,
      "ai_reasoning": "A large gain of +6.1% indicates strong buying pressure and momentum. Actionable, reliable, good timing, and decent risk/reward. It's a strong bullish signal, particularly when combined with other indicators like volume. However, it is backward looking and the move already happened.",

      "ai_score": 85,
      "ai_reasoning": "10/20 EMA bull cross is a classic bullish signal, especially when confirmed by high volume. Actionable, fairly reliable, good timing given the price action, and decent risk/reward. Confirmed by volume which increases the score.",

      "ai_score": 78,
      "ai_reasoning": "Volume spike of 2x the average is a strong indicator of interest and conviction. Actionable, reliable, good timing, and positive risk/reward.  It validates the other bullish signals and increases confidence in the uptrend. It is less compelling than 3x volume, though.",

      "ai_score": 72,
      "ai_reasoning": "RSI overbought suggests a potential pullback, but in a strong uptrend, RSI can remain overbought for extended periods. Actionable for short-term traders, moderate reliability, questionable timing given the momentum, and limited risk/reward. The strong bullish price action tempers the bearish RSI signal.",

      "ai_score": 65,
      "ai_reasoning": "Price at the upper Bollinger Band suggests a potential reversal or consolidation. Less reliable than RSI alone, timing is decent, but the risk/reward is less favorable since it contradicts the EMA cross and volume. It is a relatively minor signal, compared to the others.",
