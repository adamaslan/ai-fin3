  "market_analysis": "Okay, here's a concise technical analysis for AAPL based on the provided data:\n\n**1. MARKET CONTEXT:**\n\nAAPL is currently experiencing a slight pullback, down 0.65%.  Technical indicators are flashing warning signs, with a cluster of overbought signals suggesting the recent uptrend may be nearing exhaustion. The high volume, being near average, isn't supporting a major move in either direction.\n\n**2. KEY TAKEAWAY:**\n\nAAPL is showing signs of being overbought and potentially overextended. A correction or consolidation period is becoming increasingly likely in the near term.\n\n**3. TREND:**\n\n*   **Short-term:** Bearish (Potential for pullback/consolidation)\n*   **Medium-term:** Neutral to Bullish (Still above 200MA, but momentum slowing)\n*   **Long-term:** Bullish (Healthy uptrend still intact)\n\n**4. RISKS:**\n\n*   **Overbought Conditions:**  Significant price correction triggered by profit-taking.\n*   **Uptrend Exhaustion:** Failure to sustain the upward momentum.\n*   **Broader Market Weakness:** Any overall market downturn could exacerbate the correction in AAPL.\n\n**5. TIMEFRAME:**\n\n*   **Short-term (Days to Weeks):**  Focus on potential shorting opportunities or waiting for a pullback to establish long positions.\n\n**6. CONFIDENCE:**\n\n*   **Medium:** The numerous overbought signals provide a reasonable basis for expecting a pullback. However, AAPL is a strong stock and can remain overbought for extended periods, particularly during periods of strong market sentiment. Also, the ADX is showing a strong uptrend currently which may need time to exhaust.\n",

    "alternative_strategy": {
      "type": "bear_put_spread",
      "description": "Buy a put at $270 and sell a put at $260. This strategy profits from a downward move in AAPL while limiting potential losses if the stock price rises. It's less risky than a straight short but also offers a smaller potential profit.",
      "entry_notes": "Ensure sufficient liquidity for options trading. Adjust strike prices based on risk tolerance and premium cost."
    },
    "risk_notes": "The primary risk is a sudden reversal in market sentiment or positive news specifically related to AAPL, triggering the stop-loss. High volatility could also lead to unexpected price swings. Consider the current market environment, potential earnings announcements, and overall macroeconomic factors before entering the trade."
