    "This notebook demonstrates a complete pipeline for performing automated technical analysis on financial assets. The process involves:\n",
    "1.  Fetching financial data using `yfinance`.\n",
    "2.  Calculating 50+ technical indicators.\n",
    "3.  Detecting over 200 trading signals.\n",
    "4.  Using the Gemini AI to analyze the signals and generate insights.\n",
    "5.  Saving the results as a structured JSON file.\n",
    "6.  Deploying the script to Google Cloud for automated execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core Logic: Indicators and Signals\n",
    "\n",
    "The core of the script first calculates a comprehensive suite of over 50 technical indicators (RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, etc.). It then uses these indicators to scan the data for over 200 predefined bullish, bearish, and neutral trading signals."
