# Building a News-Integrated Options Delta & Momentum Prediction Pipeline

## Architecture Overview

This pipeline combines three distinct data streams—news sentiment, historical options data, and real-time pricing—to produce two critical outputs: predicted options delta and stock momentum score (-100 to +100). The system operates in real-time, processing news as it arrives, updating options Greeks continuously, and recalculating momentum scores every minute.

## Component 1: News Ingestion & Sentiment Analysis

**Data Sources:** Connect to news APIs (Bloomberg, Reuters, NewsAPI) and social media feeds (Twitter/X Financial, Reddit WallStreetBets, StockTwits). Use websocket connections for real-time delivery rather than polling, reducing latency from minutes to seconds.

**Text Processing Pipeline:**
```
Raw News → Preprocessing → Embedding → Sentiment Scoring → Temporal Aggregation
```

Preprocess text by removing HTML tags, normalizing tickers ($AAPL → AAPL), and filtering for relevance using keyword matching or a lightweight classifier. For embedding, use FinBERT—a BERT model fine-tuned on financial text—which understands context like "beat earnings" (positive) versus "missed earnings" (negative) better than general-purpose models.

**Sentiment Extraction:** FinBERT outputs three probabilities: positive, negative, neutral. Convert to a signed sentiment score: `sentiment = (P_positive - P_negative) × 100`, ranging from -100 (extremely bearish) to +100 (extremely bullish). Weight recent news more heavily using exponential decay: `weighted_sentiment = Σ(sentiment_i × e^(-λ×age_hours))` where λ = 0.1 creates half-life of ~7 hours.

**Entity Linking:** Critical step often overlooked—news mentions "Apple" but your system tracks "AAPL". Use named entity recognition (NER) to extract company names, then map to tickers using a database of aliases. Handle edge cases: "Apple" the company versus "apple" the fruit, or "Meta" (new name) versus "Facebook" (old name).

## Component 2: Historical Options Data Integration

**Data Structure:** Maintain a time-series database (InfluxDB or TimescaleDB) storing historical snapshots every 15 minutes:
- Strike price, expiration date, option type (call/put)
- Bid/ask prices, implied volatility, volume, open interest
- Computed Greeks: delta, gamma, vega, theta
- Underlying stock price at snapshot time

**Feature Engineering for Delta Prediction:** Beyond current option parameters, create temporal features:
- **Volatility momentum:** Rate of change in IV over past 3 hours
- **Volume surge indicator:** Current volume vs. 20-day average
- **Skew metrics:** IV difference between OTM puts and calls
- **Term structure:** IV differences across expiration dates
- **News-IV correlation:** How much IV spiked after recent news events

Concatenate these 30+ features with the 10-20 news sentiment features (sentiment score, news volume, source credibility, topic tags) to create a unified feature vector of ~50 dimensions.

## Component 3: Delta Prediction Model

**Architecture:** Use the Transformer model from the base system but extend the input layer to accommodate news features. Add a **cross-attention mechanism** where option features attend to news embeddings, allowing the model to selectively focus on relevant news items.

```
[Option Features] ──┐
                     ├→ Cross-Attention → Transformer Encoder → Delta Prediction
[News Embeddings] ──┘
```

**Training Strategy:** Create training labels by looking forward 1 hour: "Given options data and news at time T, what was the actual delta at T+1?" This forces the model to learn how news sentiment translates into Greeks changes, not just current relationships.

**Inference:** For real-time predictions, maintain a rolling window of the past 4 hours of news. When new options quotes arrive, embed the news window using FinBERT, concatenate with option features, and forward through the model. Output both delta prediction and uncertainty estimate (via MC Dropout with 20 samples).

## Component 4: Stock Momentum Calculation

**Multi-Signal Momentum System:** Combine four momentum indicators:

1. **Price Momentum (40% weight):** RSI-based score. RSI > 70 maps to +40, RSI < 30 maps to -40, linear scaling between.

2. **Volume-Weighted Momentum (25%):** Compare today's price change weighted by volume to 20-day average: `(ΔP × Volume) / avg(ΔP × Volume)_20d`. Normalize to -25 to +25 range.

3. **News Sentiment Momentum (25%):** Use the weighted sentiment score calculated earlier, scaled to -25 to +25.

4. **Options Flow Momentum (10%):** Calculate put-call ratio and compare to historical average. Unusual call buying suggests bullish momentum. Score: `(PCR_historical - PCR_current) / std(PCR) × 10`.

**Aggregation:** Sum the four weighted components to get final momentum score on -100 to +100 scale. Apply a sigmoid smoothing to prevent jumps: `momentum_smooth = momentum × 0.3 + momentum_previous × 0.7`.

## Component 5: Pipeline Orchestration

**Microservices Architecture:**
- **News Service:** Ingests, processes, embeds news; outputs sentiment scores every 30 seconds
- **Market Data Service:** Streams live options chains and stock prices via WebSocket from broker APIs
- **Feature Engineering Service:** Combines news + options data into model-ready features
- **Prediction Service:** Runs GPU-accelerated inference, outputs delta predictions
- **Momentum Service:** Aggregates signals, computes final -100 to +100 score
- **API Gateway:** Exposes REST endpoints for client applications

**Data Flow:** Use Apache Kafka or Redis Streams as message queue between services. News sentiment → Topic: "sentiment_scores", Options data → Topic: "options_feed", Predictions → Topic: "model_outputs". This decouples services and allows scaling bottlenecks independently.

**Latency Optimization:** Target end-to-end latency of <500ms from news arrival to momentum update:
- News processing: 100ms (batched FinBERT inference on GPU)
- Feature engineering: 50ms (vectorized NumPy operations)
- Delta prediction: 150ms (model forward pass + uncertainty)
- Momentum calculation: 50ms (simple arithmetic)
- Publishing: 50ms (Kafka write)
- Buffer: 100ms

**Monitoring:** Track drift in news sentiment distribution (sudden spike in negative news volume might indicate breaking bad news), model prediction accuracy against realized deltas over next hour, and momentum score correlation with actual price movements over next 30 minutes.

## Deployment & Scaling

Deploy on Kubernetes for auto-scaling during high-news periods (earnings season, Fed announcements). Use horizontal pod autoscaling: when news ingestion queue exceeds 1000 items, spin up additional FinBERT inference pods. Store predictions in Redis cache with 15-minute TTL for fast lookups by client applications.

This integrated pipeline transforms disparate data sources into actionable trading signals, combining the explanatory power of options markets with the forward-looking nature of news sentiment to capture momentum before it's fully reflected in prices.
