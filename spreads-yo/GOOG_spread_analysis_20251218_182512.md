**Strategy:** Sell $295.0 / Buy $290.0
**Est. Credit:** $99.5 | **Max Risk:** $400.5
**Analysis:**
Given GOOG's price near its 50-day SMA and a bearish MACD, this Put Credit Spread could be interesting as it capitalizes on potential short-term downside momentum. The strategy offers a favorable risk-reward ratio (1:4) and benefits from the relatively high implied volatility (34%), which may inflate the premium received. However, the RSI suggests the stock may be oversold, so caution is advised.
