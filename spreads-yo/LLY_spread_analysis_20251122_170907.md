### Put Credit Spread (2025-12-05)
**Strategy:** Sell $1030.0 / Buy $1025.0
**Est. Credit:** $152.5 | **Max Risk:** $347.5
**Analysis:**
Given the current market context for Eli Lilly and Company (LLY), a put credit spread appears to be an intriguing strategy, particularly considering the stock's overbought condition and the bullish momentum it has exhibited. With the Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 89.09, significantly above the overbought threshold of 70, there is a strong indication that LLY may be due for a pullback or consolidation in the near term. This is further supported by the Stochastic %K at 96.23, which also suggests that the stock is overbought and potentially ripe for a correction. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) value of 61.04, coupled with a signal line of 53.71, indicates a bullish trend, but the extreme RSI reading suggests that this trend may be overextended.

The Bollinger Band %B at 0.83 reinforces this view, as it shows that the stock price is trading well above its 20-day moving average, another sign of potential overvaluation in the short term. The Money Flow Index (MFI) at 86.42 also suggests strong buying pressure, but again, the extreme reading may indicate that this pressure is unsustainable in the near term. The 10-day Rate of Change (ROC) at 14.81% highlights the rapid price appreciation, further supporting the idea that a pullback could be imminent.

Given these technical indicators, selling a put credit spread with a sell strike at $1030.00 and a buy strike at $1025.00 provides an opportunity to capitalize on a potential short-term pullback while maintaining a bullish or neutral bias. The risk/reward profile of this trade is favorable, with an estimated maximum profit of $152.5 and an estimated maximum risk of $347.5. This setup allows for a defined risk strategy that benefits from either a continuation of the current trend or a modest pullback, making it an attractive option in the current market environment.

It is crucial to note that this analysis is based on hypothetical scenarios and should not be construed as financial advice. Investors should conduct their own due diligence and consider their risk tolerance and investment objectives before entering any trade.

### Call Credit Spread (2025-12-05)
**Strategy:** Sell $1090.0 / Buy $1100.0
**Est. Credit:** $240.0 | **Max Risk:** $760.0
**Analysis:**
Given the current market context for Eli Lilly and Company (LLY), a call credit spread with the specified parameters presents an intriguing opportunity for investors seeking to capitalize on potential bearish or neutral market sentiment. With the Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 89.09, significantly above the overbought threshold of 70, this indicates that LLY may be experiencing a period of overvaluation and could be due for a correction or consolidation. This overbought condition is further supported by the Stochastic %K at 96.23, which also suggests that the stock may be nearing an overbought state and could potentially retract. The Bollinger Band %B at 0.83 reinforces this notion, as it indicates that the price is trading near the upper boundary of its recent volatility range, increasing the likelihood of a mean reversion.

The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) value of 61.04, while still bullish with a positive signal at 53.71, shows signs of potential weakening momentum, as the rate of change (10d) at 14.81% suggests a rapid price increase that may not be sustainable in the short term. The Money Flow Index (MFI) at 86.42, although high, does not necessarily contradict this bearish outlook, as it reflects strong buying pressure but does not guarantee continued upward momentum.

The technical indicators collectively suggest that LLY may be poised for a pullback or sideways movement, making a call credit spread an attractive strategy. By selling the $1090.00 call and buying the $1100.00 call, the investor can capitalize on this potential downside or stagnation while limiting risk. The estimated maximum profit of $240.0 contrasts with an estimated maximum risk of $760.0, resulting in a risk-reward ratio of approximately 1:3.25, which is favorable for a credit spread strategy. This setup allows the investor to profit from a decline in LLY's price or a period of consolidation, while the defined risk limits potential losses.

In summary, the overbought conditions indicated by the RSI, Stochastic %K, and Bollinger Band %B, coupled with the potential weakening momentum suggested by the MACD and rate of change, create a compelling case for a call credit spread on LLY. This strategy aligns with the current technical landscape and offers a favorable risk-reward profile for investors anticipating a bearish or neutral market sentiment.

### Put Credit Spread (2025-12-19)
**Strategy:** Sell $1020.0 / Buy $1000.0
**Est. Credit:** $562.5 | **Max Risk:** $1437.5
**Analysis:**
Given the current market context for Eli Lilly and Company (LLY), a put credit spread with the specified parameters presents an intriguing opportunity for investors seeking to capitalize on the stock's overbought condition while maintaining a bullish to neutral stance. With the Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 89.09, significantly above the overbought threshold of 70, and the Stochastic %K at 96.23, LLY appears to be in a state of potential overvaluation in the short term. This is further supported by the Bollinger Band %B at 0.83, indicating that the stock price is trading near the upper boundary of its recent volatility range. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) value of 61.04, coupled with a bullish signal at 53.71, suggests underlying momentum, but the Money Flow Index (MFI) at 86.42 hints at a potential cooling off period as buying pressure may be nearing saturation.

The technical indicators collectively suggest that while LLY has experienced strong upward momentum, there may be a short-term correction or consolidation phase ahead. This makes a put credit spread an attractive strategy, as it allows investors to profit from a potential pullback or sideways movement in the stock price. The chosen strikes of $1020.00 for the sold put and $1000.00 for the bought put provide a buffer against downward movement while still capturing credit premiums. The risk/reward profile of this trade is particularly appealing, with an estimated maximum profit of $562.5 and a maximum risk of $1437.5, offering a favorable reward-to-risk ratio. The 30-day historical volatility at 0.27 implies that significant price swings are less likely in the near term, further supporting the strategy's viability.

In summary, the confluence of overbought conditions, strong bullish momentum, and high money flow suggests that LLY may be due for a short-term consolidation or correction. The put credit spread strategy capitalizes on this potential scenario, offering a balanced approach to profit from a market pullback while limiting downside risk. However, investors should remain vigilant and monitor the stock's performance closely, as market conditions can change rapidly. This analysis is hypothetical and should not be construed as financial advice.

### Call Credit Spread (2025-12-19)
**Strategy:** Sell $1100.0 / Buy $1120.0
**Est. Credit:** $662.5 | **Max Risk:** $1337.5
**Analysis:**
Given the current market context for Eli Lilly and Company (LLY), a call credit spread with an expiration date of December 19, 2025, selling the $1100 strike and buying the $1120 strike, presents an intriguing opportunity for traders seeking to capitalize on potential bearish or neutral market sentiment. With the Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 89.09, LLY is firmly in overbought territory, suggesting that the stock may be due for a correction or consolidation period. This overbought condition is further supported by the Stochastic %K at 96.23, which also indicates that the stock is potentially overvalued in the short term. The Bollinger Band %B at 0.83 reinforces this notion, as it shows that the price is trading near the upper boundary of its recent volatility range.

The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) value of 61.04 and signal line at 53.71, while still bullish, may be showing early signs of a potential downturn as the momentum starts to wane. Additionally, the Money Flow Index (MFI) at 86.42 indicates strong buying pressure, but this could be a sign of exhaustion given the overbought conditions highlighted by other indicators. The 10-day Rate of Change (ROC) at 14.81% suggests a significant upward move in the recent past, which could be unsustainable in the near term.

The risk/reward profile of this call credit spread is particularly appealing. With an estimated maximum profit of $662.5 and a maximum risk of $1337.5, the trade offers a favorable risk/reward ratio. The trade structure benefits from the potential for a decline or stagnation in LLY's price, aligning well with the bearish or neutral signals provided by the technical indicators. However, it is crucial to note that this analysis is hypothetical and should not be construed as financial advice. Traders should conduct their own thorough analysis and consider their risk tolerance and investment objectives before entering any trade.

In summary, the call credit spread on LLY appears to be a strategically sound option given the current technical indicators, offering a balanced approach to potentially profit from a market correction or consolidation while managing risk effectively.

### Put Credit Spread (2026-01-02)
**Strategy:** Sell $1030.0 / Buy $1025.0
**Est. Credit:** $182.5 | **Max Risk:** $317.5
**Analysis:**
Given the current market context for Eli Lilly and Company (LLY), a put credit spread appears to be an intriguing strategy, particularly considering the stock's overbought condition and strong upward momentum. With the Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 89.09, well above the overbought threshold of 70, and the Stochastic %K at 96.23, the stock shows signs of being potentially overextended in the short term. This suggests that a pullback or consolidation might be imminent, making a put credit spread an appealing strategy to capitalize on a potential decline or sideways movement. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) is bullish with a value of 61.04 and a signal of 53.71, indicating strong upward momentum, but the Bollinger Band %B at 0.83 suggests the stock is trading near the upper boundary of its recent volatility range, further supporting the notion of an overbought condition.

The 30-day historical volatility (HV) at 0.27 indicates moderate volatility, which is favorable for options strategies as it provides a balance between potential price movement and stability. The Money Flow Index (MFI) at 86.42 suggests strong buying pressure, but given the overbought conditions, this could be a sign of exhaustion rather than sustained momentum. The Rate of Change (10d) at 14.81% underscores the recent rapid price appreciation, which could lead to a mean reversion.

The specific put credit spread structure involves selling the $1030 strike and buying the $1025 strike with an expiration date of January 2, 2026. This setup offers an estimated maximum profit of $182.5, with a maximum risk of $317.5, resulting in a risk-reward ratio of approximately 1:1.7. The risk-reward profile is relatively balanced, but the potential for profit is slightly higher than the risk, making it an attractive trade if the stock remains stable or declines modestly. The Greeks for the short leg are not provided, but typically in a put credit spread, the delta would be negative, indicating a slight bearish bias, while theta would be positive, benefiting from time decay.

In summary, the combination of overbought technical indicators, strong recent momentum, and moderate volatility makes this put credit spread an interesting strategy to consider. The trade thesis is based on the expectation that LLY will either stabilize or experience a slight decline, allowing the trader to profit from the premium received while managing risk through the defined spread. However, it is crucial to monitor the stock's price action closely and adjust the strategy as needed, as market conditions can change rapidly. As always, this analysis is hypothetical and should not be construed as financial advice.

### Call Credit Spread (2026-01-02)
**Strategy:** Sell $1090.0 / Buy $1100.0
**Est. Credit:** $375.0 | **Max Risk:** $625.0
**Analysis:**
Given the current market context for Eli Lilly and Company (LLY), a call credit spread with an expiration date of January 2, 2026, selling the $1090 strike and buying the $1100 strike, presents an intriguing opportunity for traders seeking to capitalize on potential bearish or neutral market sentiment. With the Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 89.09, significantly above the overbought threshold of 70, this indicates that LLY may be experiencing a period of excessive bullish momentum, suggesting a potential reversal or consolidation in the near term. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) value of 61.04, while still bullish, shows signs of weakening momentum as it approaches the signal line at 53.71. Additionally, the Stochastic %K at 96.23 further supports the notion of an overbought condition, increasing the likelihood of a pullback.

The Bollinger Band %B value of 0.83 indicates that the price is trading near the upper boundary of its recent volatility range, reinforcing the potential for a mean reversion. The Money Flow Index (MFI) at 86.42 suggests strong buying pressure, but given the overbought conditions highlighted by other indicators, this could be a sign of exhaustion rather than sustained upward momentum. The 10-day Rate of Change (ROC) at 14.81% underscores the recent rapid price appreciation, which may not be sustainable in the short term.

From a risk management perspective, this call credit spread offers an attractive risk-reward profile. The estimated maximum profit of $375.0 is achieved if LLY closes at or below the $1090 strike at expiration, while the maximum risk is capped at $625.0 if the stock rallies above the $1100 strike. This setup allows traders to benefit from a potential pullback or sideways movement in LLY's stock price, while limiting downside exposure. The historical volatility (HV) of 0.27 over the past 30 days suggests that the stock has been relatively stable, which could work in favor of this strategy if volatility remains contained.

In summary, the combination of overbought technical indicators and signs of weakening momentum makes this call credit spread an appealing option for traders looking to capitalize on a potential reversal or consolidation in LLY's stock price. The risk-reward profile further enhances the attractiveness of this trade, offering a balanced approach to navigating the current market conditions. However, it is crucial to remember that this analysis is hypothetical and should not be construed as financial advice. Always conduct thorough research and consider your own risk tolerance before entering any trade.

### Put Credit Spread (2026-01-16)
**Strategy:** Sell $1020.0 / Buy $1000.0
**Est. Credit:** $740.0 | **Max Risk:** $1260.0
**Analysis:**
Given the current market context for Eli Lilly and Company (LLY), a put credit spread appears to be an intriguing strategy, particularly considering the stock's overbought conditions and strong upward momentum. With the Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 89.09, significantly above the overbought threshold of 70, and the Stochastic %K at 96.23, the stock shows signs of potential short-term mean reversion. This is further supported by the Bollinger Band %B at 0.83, indicating that the price is trading well above its 20-day moving average. Despite these overbought signals, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) value of 61.04 and its signal line at 53.71 suggest a persistent bullish momentum, while the Money Flow Index (MFI) at 86.42 indicates strong buying pressure. The 10-day Rate of Change (ROC) of 14.81% underscores this robust upward trend.

The put credit spread structure, with a sell strike at $1020.00 and a buy strike at $1000.00, capitalizes on this bullish yet potentially overbought scenario. The strategy aims to profit from a neutral to slightly bullish outlook, with an estimated maximum profit of $740.0 and a maximum risk of $1260.0, offering a favorable risk-reward profile. The trade's thesis is bolstered by the 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) at 854.94 and the 200-day SMA at 800.44, both of which are well below the current price, indicating a strong long-term uptrend. However, the high volatility, as evidenced by the 30-day Historical Volatility (HV) of 0.27, suggests that the stock could experience significant price swings, making a credit spread an attractive option to benefit from time decay (theta) while limiting downside risk.

In summary, this put credit spread on LLY is positioned to take advantage of the stock's strong upward momentum while hedging against potential short-term pullbacks due to overbought conditions. The strategy's risk-reward profile is compelling, with the potential for consistent returns if the stock remains stable or continues its upward trajectory. However, investors should remain vigilant about the high volatility and monitor key technical indicators closely to adjust their positions as needed. As always, this analysis is hypothetical and should not be construed as financial advice.

### Call Credit Spread (2026-01-16)
**Strategy:** Sell $1100.0 / Buy $1120.0
**Est. Credit:** $720.0 | **Max Risk:** $1280.0
**Analysis:**
Given the current market context for Eli Lilly and Company (LLY), a call credit spread with an expiration date of January 16, 2026, selling the $1100 strike and buying the $1120 strike, presents an intriguing opportunity for traders seeking to capitalize on potential bearish or neutral market movements. With the Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 89.09, LLY is firmly in overbought territory, suggesting that the stock may be due for a correction or consolidation period. This overbought condition is further supported by the Stochastic %K at 96.23, which also indicates potential overvaluation and a possible impending pullback. The Bollinger Band %B at 0.83 reinforces this notion, as it signifies that the stock price is trading near the upper boundary of its Bollinger Bands, another sign of potential overbought conditions.

The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) value of 61.04 and signal line at 53.71 indicate a bullish trend, but the extreme overbought conditions highlighted by the RSI and Stochastic %K suggest that this bullish momentum may be nearing exhaustion. The Money Flow Index (MFI) at 86.42 also supports this view, as it indicates strong buying pressure but could signal that the buying momentum is becoming less sustainable. The Rate of Change (10d) at 14.81% further underscores the recent strong upward movement, which may be unsustainable in the near term.

Given these technical indicators, a call credit spread appears to be a strategic choice. This strategy benefits from either a decline in the stock price or a sideways movement, both of which are plausible given the current overbought conditions. The risk/reward profile of this trade is particularly attractive, with an estimated maximum profit of $720.0 and an estimated maximum risk of $1280.0. This setup allows traders to capitalize on potential downside movements while limiting their risk exposure. However, it is crucial to note that this analysis is hypothetical and should not be construed as financial advice. Traders should conduct their own thorough analysis and consider their risk tolerance and investment objectives before entering any trade.

In summary, the call credit spread on LLY is an interesting strategy given the current technical indicators, which suggest that the stock may be overvalued and due for a correction. The risk/reward profile of this trade is favorable, making it a compelling option for traders looking to profit from potential bearish or neutral market movements.

### Put Credit Spread (2026-02-20)
**Strategy:** Sell $1030.0 / Buy $1020.0
**Est. Credit:** $427.5 | **Max Risk:** $572.5
**Analysis:**
Given the current market context for Eli Lilly and Company (LLY), a put credit spread appears to be an intriguing strategy, particularly for investors seeking to capitalize on the stock's overbought condition while maintaining a bullish or neutral stance. With the Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 89.09, significantly above the overbought threshold of 70, it suggests that LLY may be due for a pullback or consolidation in the near term. This is further supported by the Stochastic %K at 96.23, indicating that the stock is trading near the upper bounds of its recent price range. The Bollinger Band %B at 0.83 also corroborates this, as it shows that the price is well above its 20-day moving average, another sign of potential overbought conditions.

Despite these short-term indicators, the broader trend remains bullish, with both the 50-day and 200-day simple moving averages (SMA) at 854.94 and 800.44 respectively, well below the current price of $1059.70. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) value of 61.04, coupled with a signal line of 53.71, further supports this bullish sentiment. The Money Flow Index (MFI) at 86.42 indicates strong buying pressure, while the Rate of Change (10d) at 14.81% highlights the recent upward momentum.

Given this mixed technical picture, a put credit spread with a sell strike at $1030.00 and a buy strike at $1020.00, expiring on 2026-02-20, offers an attractive risk-reward profile. The strategy allows investors to profit from a potential pullback or sideways movement in LLY's price while limiting downside risk. The estimated maximum profit of $427.5 contrasts with an estimated maximum risk of $572.5, providing a favorable reward-to-risk ratio. This setup is particularly appealing given the current overbought conditions and the potential for mean reversion, while still allowing for participation in any continued upward momentum. However, it is crucial to note that this analysis is hypothetical and should not be construed as financial advice. Investors should conduct their own due diligence and consider their risk tolerance and investment objectives before entering any trade.

### Call Credit Spread (2026-02-20)
**Strategy:** Sell $1090.0 / Buy $1100.0
**Est. Credit:** $450.0 | **Max Risk:** $550.0
**Analysis:**
Given the current market context for Eli Lilly and Company (LLY), a call credit spread with the specified parameters presents an intriguing opportunity for traders seeking to capitalize on potential bearish or neutral market sentiment. With the Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 89.09, LLY is firmly in overbought territory, suggesting that the stock may be due for a correction or consolidation period. This overbought condition is further supported by the Stochastic %K at 96.23, indicating that the stock is nearing the upper bounds of its recent trading range. The Bollinger Band %B at 0.83 also supports this notion, as it suggests that the stock price is trading near the upper Bollinger Band, which often serves as a resistance level.

The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) value of 61.04 and signal line at 53.71 indicate a bullish momentum, but the high RSI and Stochastic values suggest that this momentum may be unsustainable in the short term. The 30-day historical volatility (HV) of 0.27 provides a measure of the stock's recent price fluctuations, which could be beneficial for options pricing and strategy implementation.

The trade structure involves selling a call option at the $1090 strike and buying a call option at the $1100 strike, both expiring on 2026-02-20. This setup allows traders to take advantage of the potential overbought conditions while maintaining a defined risk/reward profile. The estimated maximum profit of $450 aligns with a moderate bullish or neutral outlook, while the estimated maximum risk of $550 provides a clear risk management boundary. The Greeks for the short leg are not provided, but understanding delta and theta would be crucial for assessing the directionality and time decay benefits of this strategy.

In summary, this call credit spread on LLY is positioned to benefit from a potential pullback or sideways movement in the stock price, given the overbought technical indicators. The risk/reward profile is balanced, offering a reasonable return for taking on a measured level of risk. However, traders should carefully consider their market outlook and risk tolerance before implementing this strategy. Disclaimer: This analysis is hypothetical and should not be construed as financial advice.

### Put Credit Spread (2026-06-18)
**Strategy:** Sell $1030.0 / Buy $1020.0
**Est. Credit:** $432.5 | **Max Risk:** $567.5
**Analysis:**
Given the current market context for Eli Lilly and Company (LLY), a put credit spread appears to be an intriguing strategy, particularly considering the stock's overbought condition and strong upward momentum. With the Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 89.09, well above the overbought threshold of 70, and the Stochastic %K at 96.23, the stock shows signs of potential short-term mean reversion, making a bearish or neutral strategy appealing. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) value of 61.04, coupled with a signal line of 53.71, indicates persistent bullish momentum, but the Bollinger Band %B at 0.83 suggests that the stock is trading near the upper boundary of its recent volatility range, hinting at a possible pullback. The Money Flow Index (MFI) at 86.42 further supports the idea of strong buying pressure, but the Rate of Change (10d) at 14.81% indicates a significant recent rally, which may not be sustainable in the short term.

The put credit spread structure, with a sell strike at $1030.00 and a buy strike at $1020.00, capitalizes on this potential for mean reversion while maintaining a bullish or neutral outlook. The estimated maximum profit of $432.5 contrasts with an estimated maximum risk of $567.5, resulting in a risk-reward ratio of approximately 1.3:1. This ratio, while not exceptionally favorable, is mitigated by the high probability of profit inherent in credit spreads, especially given the stock's current technical indicators. The 30-day historical volatility (HV) at 0.27 suggests moderate volatility, which aligns well with the strategy's goal of capturing time decay (theta) while limiting downside risk.

In summary, this put credit spread on LLY leverages the stock's overbought condition and recent strong performance to position for a potential pullback or consolidation. The risk-reward profile, combined with the technical indicators, makes this strategy a compelling option for investors seeking to capitalize on short-term market dynamics while managing risk effectively. However, it is crucial to remember that this analysis is hypothetical and should not be construed as financial advice. Always conduct thorough research and consider personal risk tolerance before executing any trade.

**Analysis:**
Given the current market context for Eli Lilly and Company (LLY), a call credit spread with an expiration date of June 18, 2026, selling the $1100 strike and buying the $1120 strike, presents an intriguing opportunity for investors seeking to capitalize on potential bearish or neutral market sentiment.

Additionally, the Stochastic %K at 96.23 suggests that the stock is nearing overbought territory, reinforcing the bearish outlook. The Bollinger Band %B at 0.83 indicates that the stock is trading near the upper boundary of its recent price range, which could signal a reversal.

The risk/reward profile of this trade is particularly attractive. With an estimated maximum profit of $877.5 and a maximum risk of $1122.5, the trade offers a favorable reward-to-risk ratio. The high volatility, as indicated by the 30-day historical volatility of 0.27, suggests that there is significant potential for price movement, which could work in favor of the call credit spread strategy. Furthermore, the Money Flow Index (MFI) at 86.42 indicates strong buying pressure, but given the overbought conditions, this could lead to a short-term pullback, providing an opportunity for the call credit spread to profit.

In summary, the combination of overbought technical indicators, slowing momentum, and high volatility makes this call credit spread on LLY an interesting trade for investors looking to capitalize on a potential market correction. The favorable risk/reward profile adds to the appeal of this strategy, making it a compelling option for those with a bearish or neutral outlook on LLY. However, it is essential to remember that this analysis is hypothetical and should not be construed as financial advice. Investors should conduct their own due diligence and consider their risk tolerance before entering any trade.
