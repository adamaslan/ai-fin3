### Put Credit Spread (2026-01-02)
**Strategy:** Sell $24.0 / Buy $19.0
**Est. Credit:** $122.0 | **Max Risk:** $378.0
**Analysis:**
Given the current market context for QBTS, a Put Credit Spread with the specified parameters presents an intriguing opportunity for investors seeking to capitalize on the stock's recent price action and technical indicators. The stock is currently trading at $24.89, which is below its 50-day simple moving average (SMA50) of $29.04 but above its 200-day SMA of $18.41, indicating a potential range-bound or consolidating phase. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) of 54.75 suggests that the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, providing a neutral momentum signal. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) value of -0.48 and signal of -0.58 indicate a bullish crossover, which could suggest a potential upward momentum in the near term.

The stochastic %K of 45.59 and the Bollinger Band %B of 0.53 further support the notion that the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, and it is trading within its recent volatility range. The Money Flow Index (MFI) of 45.91 indicates a balanced flow of money into and out of the stock, while the 10-day Rate of Change (ROC) of -13.37% highlights a recent downward trend. Given these indicators, selling a put credit spread with a strike price of $24.00 and buying a put with a strike price of $19.00 provides a strategic approach to benefit from the stock's potential upward momentum while limiting downside risk.

The estimated maximum profit of $122.0 suggests a reasonable return on investment, while the estimated maximum risk of $378.0 provides a clear risk-reward ratio for the trade. This setup allows investors to take advantage of the stock's current technical indicators and market context, potentially profiting from a bullish reversal or continued consolidation within the identified range. However, it is crucial to monitor the trade closely, as market conditions can change rapidly, and the analysis should be continuously updated to reflect new information and developments.

### Call Credit Spread (2026-01-02)
**Strategy:** Sell $25.5 / Buy $30.5
**Est. Credit:** $125.5 | **Max Risk:** $374.5
**Analysis:**
Given the current market context for QBTS, a call credit spread with the specified parameters presents an intriguing opportunity for investors seeking to capitalize on the stock's potential range-bound behavior while also benefiting from a slight bullish bias. The stock's price at $24.89 is positioned below its 50-day simple moving average (SMA50) of $29.04 but above its 200-day SMA of $18.41, indicating a short-term downtrend within a longer-term uptrend. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 54.75 suggests that the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, providing a neutral momentum signal. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) value of -0.48 and its signal line at -0.58 indicate a bullish crossover, which could suggest potential upward momentum in the near term. The stochastic %K at 45.59 and the Bollinger Band %B at 0.53 further support the notion that the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, reinforcing the idea of a balanced market sentiment.

The 30-day historical volatility (HV) of 1.10 implies moderate price fluctuations, which could be favorable for options trading strategies like credit spreads that aim to profit from contained volatility. The Money Flow Index (MFI) at 45.91 indicates a neutral money flow, suggesting that there is no significant buying or selling pressure. However, the Rate of Change (10d) at -13.37% highlights a recent decline in the stock price, which could present an opportunity to sell calls at a higher strike price ($25.50) while buying calls at a much higher strike price ($30.50) to limit downside risk.

The trade structure, with an expiration date of January 2, 2026, allows for a long-term outlook, providing ample time for the market to potentially move in the desired direction. The estimated maximum profit of $125.5 and maximum risk of $374.5 offer a risk-reward ratio that might be appealing to investors looking for a balanced approach to options trading. This setup could be particularly attractive if the investor anticipates QBTS to trade within a range or experience moderate upward movement, allowing the sold call to expire worthless while the bought call provides downside protection. However, it is crucial to monitor the stock's performance and adjust the strategy as needed, given the dynamic nature of the market.

### Put Credit Spread (2026-01-16)
**Strategy:** Sell $24.0 / Buy $19.0
**Est. Credit:** $171.5 | **Max Risk:** $328.5
**Analysis:**
In the current market context, a Put Credit Spread on QBTS presents an intriguing opportunity, particularly when considering the technical indicators and the trade structure. The stock's price of $24.89 is positioned above both the 50-day simple moving average (SMA50) of $29.04 and the 200-day simple moving average (SMA200) of $18.41, suggesting a potential bullish trend. However, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 54.75 indicates neither overbought nor oversold conditions, providing a neutral stance on momentum. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) value of -0.48, coupled with a signal line of -0.58, hints at a bullish crossover, which could signal upward momentum in the near term. The Stochastic %K at 45.59 further supports this neutral to slightly bullish sentiment, as it is neither in the overbought nor oversold territory.

The Bollinger Band %B at 0.53 suggests that the stock is trading slightly above its 20-day moving average but within the range of the upper and lower bands, indicating a balanced position relative to its volatility. The Money Flow Index (MFI) at 45.91 also reflects a neutral stance, with no significant buying or selling pressure. The Rate of Change (10d) at -13.37% indicates a recent decline, which could present an opportunity for a mean reversion, especially given the bullish signals from the MACD.

The trade structure, with an expiration date of January 16, 2026, and strikes at $24.00 (sell) and $19.00 (buy), offers a balanced risk-reward profile. The estimated maximum profit of $171.5 is achieved if QBTS closes at or above $24.00 at expiration, while the estimated maximum risk of $328.5 is capped if the stock falls to or below $19.00. Given the current technical indicators and the potential for mean reversion, this Put Credit Spread could be an attractive strategy for investors looking to capitalize on a potential upward movement or consolidation in QBTS, while managing risk through a defined spread. However, it is crucial to note that this analysis is hypothetical and should not be construed as financial advice. Investors should conduct their own due diligence and consider their risk tolerance before entering any trade.

### Call Credit Spread (2026-01-16)
**Strategy:** Sell $26.0 / Buy $31.0
**Est. Credit:** $129.5 | **Max Risk:** $370.5
**Analysis:**
Given the current market context for QBTS, a call credit spread with an expiration date of January 16, 2026, selling the $26.00 strike and buying the $31.00 strike, presents an intriguing opportunity for several reasons. The technical indicators suggest a nuanced market environment that could favor this strategy. The stock is currently trading at $24.89, below its 50-day simple moving average (SMA50) of $29.04 but above its 200-day SMA of $18.41, indicating a potential range-bound or consolidating phase within a broader uptrend. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 54.75 suggests neither overbought nor oversold conditions, providing room for movement in either direction. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) value of -0.48 and signal line of -0.58 indicate a bullish crossover, which could signal the beginning of an upward momentum shift. The stochastic %K at 45.59 and the Money Flow Index (MFI) at 45.91 both suggest a neutral stance but with potential for upward momentum, given the recent bullish MACD signal. The 30-day historical volatility (HV) of 1.10 and Bollinger Band %B of 0.53 indicate moderate volatility and a stock price near the middle of its recent trading range, respectively. The Rate of Change (10d) at -13.37% highlights recent downward pressure, which could present an opportunity to sell elevated implied volatility in the options market. The call credit spread allows for capitalizing on this potential volatility while limiting risk to the difference between the strikes minus the premium received, with an estimated maximum profit of $129.5 and maximum risk of $370.5. This setup could be particularly appealing if the trader anticipates QBTS to remain range-bound or experience only modest upward movement over the long term, allowing the sold call to expire worthless while keeping the bought call as a hedge against significant upward moves. However, it is crucial to note that this analysis is hypothetical and does not constitute financial advice, as market conditions can change rapidly and other factors may influence the outcome.

### Put Credit Spread (2026-01-30)
**Strategy:** Sell $24.0 / Buy $19.0
**Est. Credit:** $nan | **Max Risk:** $nan
**Analysis:**
Given the current market context for QBTS, a put credit spread with a sell strike at $24.00 and a buy strike at $19.00, expiring on January 30, 2026, presents an intriguing opportunity for several reasons. The stock's price of $24.89 is positioned above both the 50-day simple moving average (SMA50) of $29.04 and the 200-day simple moving average (SMA200) of $18.41, indicating a potential bullish trend, albeit with some recent downward momentum as evidenced by the 10-day rate of change of -13.37%. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) value of -0.48 and its signal line at -0.58 suggest a bullish crossover, which could imply a potential upward reversal in the near term. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 54.75 indicates that the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, providing a neutral stance but with room for upward movement. The Bollinger Band %B at 0.53 suggests that the stock is trading near the middle of its recent trading range, which could be a sign of consolidation before a breakout. The Money Flow Index (MFI) at 45.91 indicates moderate buying pressure, while the stochastic %K at 45.59 suggests that the stock is neither overbought nor oversold but trending upwards. The 30-day historical volatility (HV) of 1.10 implies moderate price fluctuations, which could be favorable for options strategies like credit spreads that benefit from time decay and moderate volatility.

The chosen strikes for the put credit spread are strategically placed below the current stock price, with the sell strike at $24.00 providing a buffer against potential downward movements while still capturing potential upside. The buy strike at $19.00 offers downside protection, limiting the maximum risk to the difference between the two strikes minus the premium received. Given the bullish indicators and the stock's position above key moving averages, this setup could be attractive for investors looking to capitalize on potential upward momentum while managing risk through defined loss parameters. However, it is crucial to monitor the stock's performance closely, as any significant downward movement could erode the benefits of this strategy. This analysis is hypothetical and should not be construed as financial advice.

### Call Credit Spread (2026-01-30)
**Strategy:** Sell $25.5 / Buy $30.5
**Est. Credit:** $nan | **Max Risk:** $nan
**Analysis:**
Given the current market context for QBTS, a call credit spread with an expiration date of January 30, 2026, selling the $25.50 strike and buying the $30.50 strike presents an intriguing opportunity for several reasons. Firstly, the trend indicators suggest a bullish bias, with the 50-day simple moving average (SMA50) at $29.04 significantly above the 200-day simple moving average (SMA200) at $18.41, indicating a strong upward trend. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) value of -0.48 is also above its signal line of -0.58, reinforcing this bullish sentiment.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 54.75 suggests that QBTS is neither overbought nor oversold, providing a balanced environment for a credit spread. The Stochastic %K at 45.59 further supports this neutral stance, indicating that the stock is not at extreme levels. The Bollinger Band %B at 0.53 suggests that the current price is within the middle range of its recent volatility, which is consistent with the 30-day historical volatility (HV30d) of 1.10.

The Money Flow Index (MFI) at 45.91 indicates moderate buying pressure, while the Rate of Change (10d) at -13.37% suggests a recent pullback, which could present an opportunity to sell calls at a relatively high strike price. The chosen strikes of $25.50 and $30.50 are strategically placed to capitalize on the bullish trend while providing a cushion against potential downside movements.

The long-term expiration date of January 30, 2026, allows for a significant time horizon to benefit from the bullish trend, while the credit received from selling the $25.50 call provides immediate income. The maximum profit is realized if QBTS closes below the $25.50 strike at expiration, while the maximum risk is limited to the difference between the two strikes minus the credit received.

In summary, this call credit spread setup on QBTS leverages the bullish trend indicated by the moving averages and MACD, while the RSI, Stochastic %K, and MFI suggest a balanced market environment. The recent pullback and moderate volatility provide a favorable context for selling calls at a higher strike, making this strategy potentially attractive for investors seeking to capitalize on QBTS's upward momentum while managing risk effectively.

### Put Credit Spread (2026-02-20)
**Strategy:** Sell $24.0 / Buy $19.0
**Est. Credit:** $221.0 | **Max Risk:** $279.0
**Analysis:**
In the current market context, a Put Credit Spread on QBTS presents an intriguing opportunity, particularly given the stock's technical indicators and the structure of the trade. The stock is currently trading at $24.89, slightly below its 50-day simple moving average (SMA50) of $29.04, but well above its 200-day SMA of $18.41. This positioning suggests a potential bullish bias in the medium term, as the price is above the long-term support level. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 54.75, indicating neither overbought nor oversold conditions, which provides a neutral momentum backdrop. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) shows a bullish signal with a value of -0.48 and a signal line at -0.58, suggesting a potential upward momentum shift. The stochastic %K at 45.59 also supports this view, indicating that the stock is neither overbought nor oversold but trending upwards.

The volatility, as measured by the 30-day historical volatility (HV30d) at 1.10, is relatively moderate, which is favorable for options strategies like credit spreads that benefit from stable or slightly increasing volatility. The Bollinger Band %B at 0.53 indicates that the stock is trading near the middle of its recent trading range, providing a balanced risk-reward profile. The Money Flow Index (MFI) at 45.91 suggests a neutral money flow, while the Rate of Change (10d) at -13.37% indicates a recent downward trend, which could present an opportunity for a mean reversion strategy.

The trade structure involves selling a put option at the $24.00 strike and buying a put option at the $19.00 strike, both expiring on 2026-02-20. This setup allows for an estimated maximum profit of $221.0 while capping the maximum risk at $279.0. Given the current price and the technical indicators, this Put Credit Spread could be particularly attractive if the market stabilizes or experiences a slight upward correction. The strategy benefits from the stock's current position above the long-term support level and the moderate volatility environment, which could enhance the probability of the options expiring worthless or being closed at a profit before expiration. However, it is crucial to monitor the stock's performance closely, as any significant downward movement could increase the risk of assignment and potential losses. This analysis is hypothetical and should not be construed as financial advice.

**Analysis:**
Given the current market context for QBTS, a put credit spread with a sell strike at $24.00 and a buy strike at $19.00, expiring on March 20, 2026, presents an intriguing opportunity for several reasons. The stock's price of $24.89 is positioned above both the 50-day simple moving average (SMA50) of $29.04 and the 200-day simple moving average (SMA200) of $18.41, indicating a potential bullish trend despite the recent 13.37% rate of change over the past 10 days. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) value of -0.48 and signal line of -0.58 suggest a bullish momentum, which is further supported by the Relative Strength Index (RSI) of 54.75, indicating neither overbought nor oversold conditions.

### Call Credit Spread (2026-03-20)
**Strategy:** Sell $26.0 / Buy $31.0
**Est. Credit:** $147.5 | **Max Risk:** $352.5
**Analysis:**
Given the current market context for QBTS, a call credit spread with the specified parameters presents an intriguing opportunity for a quantitative financial analyst to consider. The stock's price at $24.89 is notably below its 50-day simple moving average (SMA50) of $29.04, indicating a short-term downtrend, while it remains above the 200-day SMA of $18.41, suggesting a longer-term uptrend. This price action implies a potential mean reversion scenario, where the stock might revert to its mean price over the short to medium term. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 54.75 indicates neither overbought nor oversold conditions, providing a neutral stance for momentum. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) value of -0.48 and signal of -0.58 suggest a bullish crossover in the making, which could indicate an upward momentum shift. The stochastic %K at 45.59 and the Money Flow Index (MFI) at 45.91 both suggest that the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, but there is a slight negative bias indicated by the 10-day Rate of Change (ROC) of -13.37%. The Bollinger Band %B at 0.53 indicates that the stock is trading near the middle of its recent volatility range, and the 30-day historical volatility (HV) of 1.10 suggests moderate volatility.

Given these indicators, selling a call credit spread with a sell strike at $26.00 and a buy strike at $31.00, expiring on 2026-03-20, could be strategically interesting. The sell strike at $26.00 is above the current price and the SMA50, providing a buffer against immediate upward price movements. The buy strike at $31.00 offers a significant cushion, reducing the risk of the stock reaching that level before expiration, especially considering the current trend and momentum indicators. The estimated maximum profit of $147.5 and maximum risk of $352.5 present a favorable risk-reward ratio, particularly if the stock exhibits mean reversion and trades within the specified range. This setup allows the analyst to capitalize on potential upside movements while limiting downside risk, making it a compelling strategy in the current market context. However, it is crucial to monitor the stock's performance closely and adjust the strategy as needed based on evolving market conditions and technical indicators.

### Put Credit Spread (2026-06-18)
**Strategy:** Sell $24.0 / Buy $19.0
**Est. Credit:** $245.0 | **Max Risk:** $255.0
**Analysis:**
In the current market context, a Put Credit Spread on QBTS presents an intriguing opportunity, particularly given the stock's technical indicators and the structure of the trade. The stock is currently trading at $24.89, slightly below its 50-day simple moving average (SMA50) of $29.04, but well above its 200-day simple moving average (SMA200) of $18.41, suggesting a medium-term downtrend within a long-term uptrend. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 54.75, indicating neither overbought nor oversold conditions, which provides a neutral momentum backdrop. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) value of -0.48 and signal line of -0.58 suggest a bullish crossover, potentially indicating an upward momentum shift. The stochastic %K at 45.59 and Bollinger Band %B at 0.53 further support a neutral stance, with the stock trading near the middle of its recent price range. The Money Flow Index (MFI) of 45.91 suggests a balanced inflow and outflow of money, while the 10-day Rate of Change (ROC) of -13.37% indicates a recent decline in price momentum.

Given these indicators, the Put Credit Spread with a sell strike at $24.00 and a buy strike at $19.00, expiring on 2026-06-18, appears strategically positioned. The sell strike is slightly below the current price, capitalizing on the potential for a short-term pullback or consolidation, while the buy strike provides a substantial buffer against further downside risk. The estimated maximum profit of $245.0 is attractive, especially considering the relatively low volatility (30-day historical volatility of 1.10), which reduces the likelihood of significant price swings. The estimated maximum risk of $255.0 is manageable and aligns with the conservative nature of the trade structure. This setup allows for a balanced approach, leveraging the current technical landscape to potentially profit from a range-bound or mildly bullish scenario while mitigating downside risk through the wide spread between strikes. However, it is crucial to monitor the trade closely, as unexpected market events or shifts in volatility could impact the strategy's effectiveness.

### Call Credit Spread (2026-06-18)
**Strategy:** Sell $26.0 / Buy $31.0
**Est. Credit:** $140.0 | **Max Risk:** $360.0
**Analysis:**
In the current market context, a call credit spread on QBTS presents an intriguing opportunity, particularly when considering the technical indicators and the trade structure. The stock's price at $24.89 is notably below its 50-day simple moving average (SMA50) of $29.04, suggesting a short-term downtrend, yet it remains above the 200-day SMA of $18.41, indicating a longer-term uptrend. This price action between the two SMAs could signal a potential bullish reversal or consolidation phase, making it an opportune moment to explore bullish strategies with defined risk.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 54.75 suggests that QBTS is neither overbought nor oversold, providing a neutral momentum reading that aligns well with the current price action. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) value of -0.48 and its signal line at -0.58 are in close proximity, hinting at a potential bullish crossover in the near term. Additionally, the Stochastic %K at 45.59 indicates that the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, further supporting the neutral-to-bullish sentiment.

The 30-day historical volatility (HV) of 1.10 suggests moderate price fluctuations, which could be favorable for options strategies that benefit from implied volatility. The Bollinger Band %B at 0.53 indicates that the stock is trading near the middle of its recent price range, suggesting a balanced position for entering a credit spread. The Money Flow Index (MFI) at 45.91 and the Rate of Change (10d) at -13.37% highlight a recent decline in buying pressure but do not necessarily preclude a potential rebound.

Given this technical backdrop, selling a call credit spread with a sell strike at $26.00 and a buy strike at $31.00 for the June 2026 expiration offers a strategic approach to capitalize on a potential upside move while limiting risk. The estimated maximum profit of $140.0 provides a compelling reward relative to the estimated maximum risk of $360.0, offering a favorable risk-reward ratio. This setup allows traders to benefit from a potential rally in QBTS while maintaining defined risk parameters, making it an attractive strategy in the current market environment. However, it is crucial to note that this analysis is hypothetical and should not be construed as financial advice.
