### Put Credit Spread (2025-12-19)
**Strategy:** Sell $94.0 / Buy $89.0
**Est. Credit:** $205.0 | **Max Risk:** $295.0
**Analysis:**
Given the current market context for OKLO, a put credit spread appears to be an intriguing strategy, particularly in light of the technical indicators suggesting a potentially bullish or neutral market sentiment. With the Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 38.31, OKLO is neither overbought nor oversold, indicating a balanced momentum that could lean towards a bullish reversal or consolidation. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) value of -8.75, coupled with a signal line of -9.34, further supports a bullish outlook, as the MACD line is above the signal line, suggesting upward momentum. Additionally, the 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) at 121.33 is above the 200-day SMA at 68.67, indicating a golden cross and a long-term bullish trend. The stochastic %K at 56.04 and the Bollinger Band %B at 0.45 suggest that the stock is trading near the middle of its recent price range, providing a favorable entry point for a put credit spread.

The trade structure involves selling a put option at the $94.00 strike and buying a put option at the $89.00 strike, both expiring on 2025-12-19. This setup capitalizes on the current bullish indicators while providing downside protection. The estimated maximum profit of $205.0 is achieved if OKLO's price remains above $94.00 at expiration, while the estimated maximum risk of $295.0 occurs if the price falls below $89.00. The risk/reward ratio of approximately 1.44:1 is favorable, given the current technical landscape. The rate of change (10d) at -0.04% indicates minimal recent downward momentum, further supporting the strategy's viability. However, it is crucial to monitor the volatility (HV 30d) at 1.10 and the Money Flow Index at 45.69, as these could influence the trade's outcome.

In summary, the put credit spread on OKLO is an attractive strategy given the current technical indicators, which suggest a bullish or neutral market sentiment. The risk/reward profile is favorable, and the trade structure provides a balanced approach to capitalize on potential upward price movements while mitigating downside risk. As always, this analysis is hypothetical and should not be construed as financial advice.

### Call Credit Spread (2025-12-19)
**Strategy:** Sell $100.0 / Buy $105.0
**Est. Credit:** $180.0 | **Max Risk:** $320.0
**Analysis:**
Given the current market context for OKLO, a call credit spread with a sell strike at $100.00 and a buy strike at $105.00, expiring on 2025-12-19, presents an intriguing opportunity for traders seeking to capitalize on potential bearish or neutral market sentiment. With the Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 38.31, OKLO is not yet in oversold territory but is trending downward, suggesting a lack of strong bullish momentum. This is further supported by the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) value of -8.75, which, although slightly bullish given its position above the signal line (-9.34), indicates a weakening upward momentum. The 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA50) at 121.33 significantly above the current price of $96.59, coupled with the 200-day SMA200 at 68.67, suggests a downward trend in the medium term. The Bollinger Band %B at 0.45 indicates that the stock is trading near the lower end of its recent price range, which could imply a potential for further downward movement or consolidation.

The Stochastic %K at 56.04 suggests that the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, providing a neutral stance that aligns well with a credit spread strategy. The Money Flow Index (MFI) at 45.69 also supports this neutral outlook, indicating neither strong buying nor selling pressure. The Rate of Change (10d) at -0.04% further reinforces the lack of significant upward momentum. Volatility, as measured by the 30-day Historical Volatility (HV) at 1.10, is relatively low, which could be beneficial for a credit spread as it reduces the likelihood of large price swings that could adversely affect the trade.

The risk/reward profile of this call credit spread is favorable, with an estimated maximum profit of $180.0 and an estimated maximum risk of $320.0. This setup allows traders to benefit from a potential decline or stagnation in OKLO's stock price while limiting downside risk. The trade structure capitalizes on the current technical indicators suggesting a bearish or neutral outlook, making it an attractive option for those looking to profit from a market that appears to lack strong bullish momentum.

### Put Credit Spread (2026-01-02)
**Strategy:** Sell $94.0 / Buy $89.0
**Est. Credit:** $240.0 | **Max Risk:** $260.0
**Analysis:**
Given the current market context for OKLO, a put credit spread appears to be an intriguing strategy, particularly in light of the technical indicators suggesting a potentially bullish or neutral market sentiment. With the Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 38.31, OKLO is neither overbought nor oversold, indicating a balanced momentum that could lean towards a bullish reversal or continuation. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) value of -8.75, coupled with a signal line of -9.34, further supports a bullish outlook, as the MACD line is above the signal line, suggesting upward momentum. Additionally, the 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA50) at 121.33 is above the 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA200) at 68.67, indicating a long-term bullish trend. The Bollinger Band %B at 0.45 suggests that the stock is trading near the lower end of its recent range, which could imply an upcoming rebound.

The stochastic %K at 56.04 indicates that the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, providing further support for a neutral to bullish stance. The Money Flow Index (MFI) at 45.69 suggests moderate buying pressure, which aligns with the overall bullish sentiment. The Rate of Change (ROC) at -0.04% indicates a slight downward momentum, but given the other indicators, this could be seen as a temporary pullback rather than a sustained decline.

The put credit spread structure, with a sell strike at $94.00 and a buy strike at $89.00, offers an attractive risk-reward profile. The estimated maximum profit of $240.0 against a maximum risk of $260.0 provides a favorable reward-to-risk ratio. This setup capitalizes on the potential for OKLO to maintain or increase its value, as suggested by the technical indicators. The strategy benefits from the passage of time (theta decay) and the potential for the stock to stay above the sell strike price, allowing the trader to collect the premium while limiting downside risk.

In summary, the technical indicators for OKLO present a compelling case for a put credit spread strategy, leveraging the stock's potential for bullish momentum or stability. The risk-reward profile is favorable, making this an interesting opportunity for traders looking to capitalize on OKLO's market dynamics. However, it is crucial to remember that this analysis is hypothetical and should not be construed as financial advice. Always conduct thorough research and consider personal risk tolerance before executing any trades.

### Call Credit Spread (2026-01-02)
**Strategy:** Sell $99.0 / Buy $104.0
**Est. Credit:** $187.5 | **Max Risk:** $312.5
**Analysis:**
Given the current market context for OKLO, a call credit spread with a sell strike at $99.00 and a buy strike at $104.00, expiring on January 2, 2026, presents an intriguing opportunity for investors seeking to capitalize on potential bearish or neutral market movements. With the Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 38.31, OKLO is neither overbought nor oversold, suggesting a balanced momentum that could lean towards a downward correction given the recent negative rate of change (-0.04% over 10 days). The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) value of -8.75, slightly above the signal line at -9.34, indicates a bullish momentum that may be waning, potentially setting the stage for a bearish reversal. The Bollinger Band %B at 0.45 suggests that the current price is within the lower range of its recent volatility, reinforcing the potential for a downward move. Additionally, the Money Flow Index (MFI) at 45.69 indicates neither significant buying nor selling pressure, further supporting a neutral to bearish outlook. The 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) at 121.33, significantly above the current price of $96.59, and the 200-day SMA at 68.67, below the current price, suggest a potential downward trend as the price moves away from the higher SMA and approaches the lower one. The Stochastic %K at 56.04 also indicates a neutral position with no immediate signs of overbought or oversold conditions.

This call credit spread offers an attractive risk-reward profile, with an estimated maximum profit of $187.5 and an estimated maximum risk of $312.5. The trade structure benefits from the potential downward movement or stagnation of OKLO's stock price, as the sold call options would lose value if the stock price remains below the $99.00 strike price at expiration. The theta decay of the short call options further enhances the profitability of this strategy over time, assuming the stock price does not rise significantly. However, investors should be cautious of any unexpected bullish movements that could erode the potential gains or even result in losses if the stock price surpasses the $104.00 buy strike. This trade is particularly suitable for investors who anticipate a bearish or neutral market sentiment for OKLO in the coming months and are willing to accept the defined risk for a potentially rewarding outcome.

### Put Credit Spread (2026-01-16)
**Strategy:** Sell $95.0 / Buy $90.0
**Est. Credit:** $255.0 | **Max Risk:** $245.0
**Analysis:**
Given the current market context for OKLO, a put credit spread appears to be an intriguing strategy, particularly considering the stock's technical indicators and the potential for a bullish or neutral move. With the Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 38.31, OKLO is not in oversold territory but is trending downwards, suggesting a potential buying opportunity if the stock stabilizes or rebounds. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) value of -8.75 and signal line of -9.34 indicate a bullish crossover, which could signal an upward momentum shift. Additionally, the 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) at 121.33 is above the 200-day SMA at 68.67, reinforcing a longer-term bullish trend despite recent pullbacks. The Money Flow Index (MFI) at 45.69 suggests moderate buying pressure, while the Rate of Change (10d) at -0.04% indicates a slight downward momentum that could reverse.

The Bollinger Band %B at 0.45 suggests that the stock is trading near the lower end of its recent range, which could present a good entry point for a put credit spread. The 30-day Historical Volatility (HV) at 1.10 implies moderate volatility, which can be beneficial for options strategies as it provides a balance between potential price movement and stability. The stochastic %K at 56.04 indicates that the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, further supporting a neutral to bullish outlook.

The trade structure involves selling a put option at the $95.00 strike and buying a put option at the $90.00 strike, both expiring on 2026-01-16. This setup offers an estimated maximum profit of $255.0 and a maximum risk of $245.0, providing a favorable risk-reward profile. The strategy benefits from a potential rebound or stabilization of OKLO's price, as the stock is currently trading at $96.59, just above the sold strike price. If OKLO remains above $95.00 by expiration, both options will expire worthless, and the trader will retain the premium received, realizing the maximum profit. However, if the stock price falls below $95.00 but stays above $90.00, the trader will still make a profit, albeit reduced. The primary risk is if the stock price falls below $90.00, in which case the trader would incur losses up to the maximum risk of $245.0.

In summary, this put credit spread on OKLO is supported by technical indicators suggesting a potential rebound or stabilization, offering a favorable risk-reward profile for a bullish or neutral market outlook. As always, this analysis is hypothetical and should not be construed as financial advice.

**Est. Credit:** $205.0 | **Max Risk:** $295.0
**Analysis:**
Given the current market context for OKLO, a put credit spread appears to be an intriguing strategy, particularly considering the stock's technical indicators and the potential for a bullish or neutral move. With the Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 38.31, OKLO is not in overbought territory, suggesting there is still room for upward momentum before reaching overbought conditions.

### Call Credit Spread (2026-05-15)
**Strategy:** Sell $100.0 / Buy $105.0
**Est. Credit:** $147.5 | **Max Risk:** $352.5
**Analysis:**
Given the current market context for OKLO, a call credit spread with a sell strike at $100.00 and a buy strike at $105.00, expiring on May 15, 2026, presents an intriguing opportunity for traders seeking to capitalize on potential bearish or neutral market sentiment. With the Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 38.31, OKLO is neither overbought nor oversold, indicating a balanced momentum that could lean towards a downward correction given the recent trend. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) value of -8.75 and signal line at -9.34 suggest a bullish momentum, but the negative values hint at underlying bearish pressure. The Stochastic %K at 56.04 further supports this neutral stance, neither indicating overbought nor oversold conditions. The Bollinger Band %B at 0.45 suggests that the stock is trading near the lower end of its recent range, which could imply potential for a downward move or consolidation.

The trade structure offers an estimated maximum profit of $147.5, with a maximum risk of $352.5, resulting in a risk-reward ratio of approximately 2.4 to 1. This ratio indicates that the potential reward is relatively modest compared to the risk, but the trade's appeal lies in its ability to profit from either a slight downward movement or a neutral stance in OKLO's price. The Greeks for the short leg are not provided, but typically, a call credit spread would benefit from a decrease in the underlying asset's price or a decrease in implied volatility, both of which align with the current technical indicators suggesting potential downside or stagnation.

In summary, this call credit spread on OKLO is positioned to benefit from a bearish or neutral market outlook, supported by technical indicators that suggest a potential downward correction or consolidation. The risk-reward profile is modest but offers a strategic way to capitalize on the current market conditions without significant exposure to extreme volatility. As always, traders should conduct their own due diligence and consider their risk tolerance before entering any trade.
