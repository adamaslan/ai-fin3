### Put Credit Spread (2026-01-09)
**Strategy:** Sell $1040.0 / Buy $1035.0
**Est. Credit:** $130.0 | **Max Risk:** $370.0
**Analysis:**
This Put Credit Spread, targeting expiration in January 2026, presents a leveraged exposure to LLY’s long-term upward trajectory while capitalizing on elevated volatility and time decay. The core thesis rests on the overwhelming strength of the long-term trend, confirmed by the price ($1071.64) trading significantly above both the SMA50 ($965.01) and SMA200 ($817.95), suggesting the $1040 short strike offers substantial, multi-year support. Crucially, while the MACD exhibits a minor bearish crossover (Value 24.34 below Signal 24.91) and the Stochastic %K is high at 84.88, indicating potential short-term consolidation or retracement after a rapid 9.10% Rate of Change over the last ten days, the long duration allows any near-term weakness to be absorbed by the dominant bullish structure. Furthermore, the positioning of the RSI at 59.96 confirms strong momentum that is not yet fully exhausted (Overbought > 70), backed by a Money Flow Index of 60.22 affirming continued capital inflows. The strategy aims to monetize the high 30-day Historical Volatility (0.26) by selling premium against this robust support zone. The resulting risk profile—a Max Profit of $130 against a Max Risk of $370—accepts a less-than-optimal reward/risk ratio (approximately 1:2.85) typical of deep out-of-the-money credit spreads, prioritizing the high statistical probability that LLY will remain above the protected $1035 strike over the 24-month horizon.

### Call Credit Spread (2026-01-09)
**Strategy:** Sell $1105.0 / Buy $1110.0
**Est. Credit:** $180.0 | **Max Risk:** $320.0
**Analysis:**
This hypothetical Call Credit Spread on LLY, expiring in January 2026, presents a high-probability, short-term contrarian entry overlaid on a robust long-term bullish trend, targeting profit from near-term exhaustion or consolidation below the $1105 short strike. While the significant SMA 50/200 separation ($965.01 vs. $817.95) confirms LLY’s powerful structural uptrend, several momentum and oscillation indicators suggest the stock is currently overextended and vulnerable to a pause, which is the core thesis for selling this out-of-the-money resistance. Specifically, the Stochastic %K at 84.88 and the Bollinger Band %B at 0.69 indicate that the stock is trading near the upper extreme of its recent range and is heavily overbought, further supported by a sharp 9.10% Rate of Change (10d) signaling a rapid, unsustainable recent spike. Crucially, the short-term technical landscape provides a timely bearish confirmation via the MACD, which registers a bearish crossover with the Value (24.34) dipping just below the Signal line (24.91), signaling a momentum slowdown despite the high Money Flow Index (60.22) confirming recent accumulation. This confluence of overbought indicators—particularly the MACD weakness emerging concurrent with the high Stochastic—justifies initiating a neutral-to-bearish position well above the current price of $1071.64. The structure of the spread, defined by a $5.00 width ($1105/$1110), provides an estimated Max Profit of $180.0 against a Max Risk of $320.0, resulting in a risk/reward ratio of approximately 1.78:1. This payoff structure is characteristic of credit spreads—sacrificing high potential profit for maximized probability—implying that the analyst accepts this non-optimal ratio based on the high statistical likelihood that LLY will fail to breach the $1105 level before the long-dated 2026 expiration, utilizing the current overextension to maximize the premium capture.

### Put Credit Spread (2026-01-23)
**Strategy:** Sell $1040.0 / Buy $1035.0
**Est. Credit:** $175.0 | **Max Risk:** $325.0
**Analysis:**
The decision to initiate a long-dated Put Credit Spread (PCS) on LLY, selling the $1040 put against the defensive $1035 put, is fundamentally predicated on the stock's formidable long-term bullish structural integrity, while simultaneously acknowledging short-term exhaustion signals prevalent across several oscillators. LLY is trading in a clear uptrend, with the current price of $1071.64 holding substantially above the SMA50 ($965.01) and the SMA200 ($817.95), suggesting robust support beneath the selected short strike. However, indicators point toward a probable near-term cooling period: the Stochastic %K at 84.88 places the equity firmly in the overbought territory, corroborated by the aggressive 9.10% 10-day Rate of Change, indicating that the recent price acceleration is unsustainable and susceptible to a natural retracement or consolidation phase. While the MACD shows a minor bearish crossover (Value 24.34 below Signal 24.91), the RSI remains healthy at 59.96, suggesting momentum deceleration rather than a full reversal. This nuanced technical landscape provides the ideal setup for a PCS: the trade is a strategic bet that the long-term trend will shield the stock from breaching the $1040 support level—a critical margin of safety—even if the overbought condition (signaled by Stochastic) triggers a short-term dip. The spread's design yields an estimated Max Profit of $175.0 against an estimated Max Risk of $325.0, establishing a relatively unfavorable risk/reward ratio of approximately 1.86:1, necessitating a high-probability event (i.e., expiration far out in 2026-01-23 above the short strike) to justify the capital allocation based purely on the strength of LLY's foundational uptrend and the belief that the significant underlying support will contain any short-term profit-taking dictated by the technical exhaustion signals.

### Call Credit Spread (2026-01-23)
**Strategy:** Sell $1105.0 / Buy $1110.0
**Est. Credit:** $132.5 | **Max Risk:** $367.5
**Analysis:**
The proposed Call Credit Spread (CCS) on LLY, executed via the short $1105.00 and long $1110.00 strikes expiring in January 2026, presents an attractive neutral-to-mildly-bearish theta capture opportunity, predicated on the stock being overextended in the near term despite a powerful long-term bullish structural trend. While LLY is firmly entrenched in a long-term advance, evidenced by the significant buffer between the current price ($1071.64) and both the SMA50 ($965.01) and SMA200 ($817.95), short-term technical indicators suggest the current high-velocity move is due for consolidation, making a premium selling strategy highly appealing. Specifically, the Stochastic %K at 84.88 places the underlying asset deep into overbought territory, signaling that the momentum fueling the recent 9.10% Rate of Change (10d) is unsustainable without a cooling period. This thesis of deceleration is structurally reinforced by the MACD exhibiting a fresh bearish crossover (Value 24.34 below Signal 24.91), indicating a loss of upward kinetic energy, which typically precedes either horizontal consolidation or a minor pullback. By initiating the CCS far out-of-the-money at $1105.00, the analyst seeks to capture the substantial extrinsic value over the exceptionally long expiration period while maintaining a $33.36 buffer above the current price. However, the defined risk profile—a Max Profit of $132.50 against a substantial Max Risk of $367.50—results in a high Reward-to-Risk ratio (approximately 1:2.77), demanding high conviction that LLY will not breach the short strike, a concern slightly mitigated by the high proximity of the long strike ($1110.00) defining the $5.00 wide risk ceiling.

### Put Credit Spread (2026-01-30)
**Strategy:** Sell $1040.0 / Buy $1035.0
**Est. Credit:** $185.0 | **Max Risk:** $315.0
**Analysis:**
This specific long-dated Put Credit Spread (PCS) on LLY, executed at the 1040/1035 strikes expiring in 2026, represents a sophisticated play designed to capitalize on profound, sustained bullish inertia while defensively positioning against inevitable short-term volatility. The overwhelming foundation for this trade lies in LLY's robust long-term technical profile: the stock is trading aggressively above both the SMA 50 ($965.01) and SMA 200 ($817.95), confirming a powerful, embedded secular uptrend, supported by a healthy Money Flow Index (60.22) that indicates continued institutional accumulation. However, immediate momentum analysis presents caution: the Rate of Change (10d) at 9.10% suggests a recent parabolic spike, which is corroborated by the Stochastic %K at an elevated 84.88, indicating the potential for a near-term mean-reversion move or consolidation. Furthermore, the MACD cross—where the Value (24.34) has dipped just below the Signal line (24.91)—suggests deceleration in upward velocity, arguing against outright equity purchase and favoring a premium collection strategy. By selling the $1040 put, the analyst accepts the risk that LLY must remain above this level for the 700+ day duration. The Max Profit of $185.0 on a Max Risk of $315.0 establishes a probability-of-profit focus over a strong risk/reward ratio (0.58:1), a typical structural compromise when placing high-probability trades relatively close to the money in an environment where implied volatility remains moderate (HV 30d at 0.26). This long expiration provides extensive temporal advantage for the strong underlying trend to overcome any short-term turbulence driven by the current highly-charged momentum indicators, allowing the position to capture extrinsic value decay over a very long time horizon, provided the $1040 short strike holds as a critical support level.

### Call Credit Spread (2026-01-30)
**Strategy:** Sell $1100.0 / Buy $1110.0
**Est. Credit:** $295.0 | **Max Risk:** $705.0
**Analysis:**
The proposed Call Credit Spread on LLY, utilizing the $1100/$1110 strike structure out to the long-dated January 2026 expiration, is fundamentally positioned to profit from a short-term correction or consolidation, neutralizing the potent long-term bullish trend defined by the SMA50 ($965.01) comfortably above the SMA200 ($817.95). The thesis is predicated on technical exhaustion following a hyperbolic run, signaled prominently by the extremely elevated Stochastic %K reading of 84.88, which strongly suggests the stock is currently overextended and vulnerable to a pullback. This overbought condition is supported by a very high 10-day Rate of Change (9.10%), which implies that LLY's recent acceleration is unsustainable and likely to regress toward the mean, keeping the price comfortably below the $1100 short strike. Crucially, the short-term directional pressure is supported by a nascent bearish crossover in the MACD, where the Value (24.34) has slipped below the Signal line (24.91), reinforcing the likelihood of immediate cooling or a minor reversal, even while the RSI remains strong at 59.96. The trade seeks to capitalize on this short-term stagnation over a very extended horizon, offering a Max Profit of $295.0—representing 29.5% of the $1,000 spread width—against a Max Risk of $705.0, a profile that prioritizes a higher probability of success predicated on the expected decay of unsustainable momentum indicators.

### Put Credit Spread (2026-02-20)
**Strategy:** Sell $1040.0 / Buy $1030.0
**Est. Credit:** $382.5 | **Max Risk:** $617.5
**Analysis:**
This Put Credit Spread, targeting the 2026-02-20 expiration, establishes a neutral-to-bullish thesis capitalizing on LLY’s entrenched long-term uptrend while acknowledging signals of short-term overextension. The technical landscape overwhelmingly confirms structural strength, with the current price of $1071.64 trading substantially above both the SMA 50 ($965.01) and the SMA 200 ($817.95), suggesting robust support levels are deeply embedded. This aggressive $1040/$1030 strike placement requires the underlying equity to maintain its ascent or consolidate well above the short strike. While the overall trend is powerful—indicated by a 10-day Rate of Change of 9.10% and a Money Flow Index (MFI) of 60.22 confirming sustained positive capital flow—near-term caution is warranted: the Stochastic %K at 84.88 suggests the stock is severely extended on shorter timeframes, and the MACD having recently printed a slight bearish crossover (Value 24.34 below Signal 24.91) implies an imminent, though likely minor, retracement is due. This PCS is strategically positioned to profit from the time decay over the exceptionally long duration, expecting that even if LLY pulls back to retest near-term support—possibly towards the $1040-$1050 area—the established multi-year momentum will prevent a breach of the short strike. The structure generates an estimated maximum profit of $382.5 against a defined maximum risk of $617.5, resulting in a probability-skewed risk/reward ratio that demands high conviction that the substantial buffer ($31.64 below current price) will hold throughout the contract life.

### Call Credit Spread (2026-02-20)
**Strategy:** Sell $1100.0 / Buy $1110.0
**Est. Credit:** $392.5 | **Max Risk:** $607.5
**Analysis:**
The $1100/$1110 Call Credit Spread on LLY, extending to the 2026-02-20 expiration, is positioned as a sophisticated play seeking to capitalize on structural exhaustion following a parabolic move, rather than betting on a fundamental reversal of the underlying equity’s powerful long-term trend. While the asset’s structural foundation remains undeniably bullish, evidenced by the significant buffer between the SMA50 ($965.01) and SMA200 ($817.95), immediate tactical indicators suggest LLY is structurally overextended and primed for a period of deceleration or consolidation below the $1100 short strike. Specifically, the highly elevated 10-day Rate of Change (9.10%) combined with the Stochastic %K printing at 84.88 signals acute short-term overbought conditions and increased probability of mean reversion. This deceleration thesis is materially supported by the MACD crossover, where the Value (24.34) is currently beneath the Signal line (24.91), indicating an active bearish divergence despite the overall upward trajectory. The trade attempts to harvest extrinsic value over a lengthy horizon based on the expectation that the existing technical gravity—further suggested by the Bollinger Band %B reading of 0.69—will prevent a sustained penetration above the sold strike. The resulting risk profile offers a substantial Max Profit of $392.5, capturing 39.25% of the $10 width, yet this desirable credit necessitates absorbing a Max Risk of $607.5, translating to a suboptimal 1.55:1 risk-to-reward ratio that demands precise technical adherence to the consolidation thesis.

### Put Credit Spread (2026-03-20)
**Strategy:** Sell $1040.0 / Buy $1030.0
**Est. Credit:** $382.5 | **Max Risk:** $617.5
**Analysis:**
This long-dated Put Credit Spread on LLY is a high-conviction bullish-to-neutral positional trade, designed to monetize the strong underlying trend while structurally insulating the position against expected short-term volatility and potential consolidation. The core thesis rests on the overwhelming strength indicated by the trend analysis: the $1071.64 current price trades comfortably above the critical SMA-50 ($965.01) and SMA-200 ($817.95) technical support levels, confirming a robust multi-year uptrend. However, the structure anticipates near-term deceleration: the MACD has registered a cautionary bearish crossover (Value 24.34 < Signal 24.91), and the highly elevated Stochastic %K of 84.88 suggests the current bullish velocity is significantly stretched and due for a possible short-term mean reversion or cooling period, despite the RSI of 59.96 remaining healthy and below the overbought threshold. Placing the short $1040.00 strike $31.64 below the current price capitalizes on this anticipated consolidation, utilizing the two-year time frame (expiring 2026-03-20) as a massive probability buffer against a sustained reversal that would need to breach both current support and the high Money Flow Index reading of 60.22. The resulting defined risk profile, capturing a Max Profit of $382.50 against a Max Risk of $617.50 on the $10 wide spread, prioritizes a high probability of success based on trend endurance over aggressive premium capture, making the position sensitive primarily to the long-term maintenance of LLY's current market structure.

### Call Credit Spread (2026-03-20)
**Strategy:** Sell $1100.0 / Buy $1120.0
**Est. Credit:** $805.0 | **Max Risk:** $1195.0
**Analysis:**
This hypothetical analysis targets a Call Credit Spread (CCS) on LLY, structured for a neutral-to-mildly-bearish outcome over the long duration to March 2026, aiming for the $1100 short strike to expire out-of-the-money. While LLY exhibits formidable long-term strength, trading far above the converging SMA50 ($965.01) and SMA200 ($817.95), the technical landscape suggests the recent parabolic surge is structurally fatigued and due for a period of consolidation. The trade thesis relies heavily on the deceleration signaled by momentum indicators: specifically, the Stochastic %K at an extremely elevated 84.88 confirms the asset is deeply overbought, a condition further evidenced by the aggressive 9.10% Rate of Change (10d) which demands a pause for price discovery. Crucially, the MACD exhibits a minor bearish crossover (Value=24.34 below Signal=24.91), indicating momentum decay and a potential imminent technical reversal, which provides the primary justification for selling premium above the current price of $1071.64. By selecting strikes ($1100/$1120) that are approximately 2.65% above the current mark, the strategy seeks to monetize the high implied volatility (IV) resulting from the recent rapid ascent, betting that the existing market momentum is insufficient to breach the $28.36 buffer before expiration. However, the defined risk profile requires careful management; the structure yields a maximum profit of $805.0 against a maximum risk of $1195.0, resulting in a risk-to-reward ratio of approximately 1.48:1. This suboptimal ratio necessitates a very high probability of LLY stabilizing or pulling back slightly to justify the inherent breakout risk associated with trading against such a powerful underlying uptrend.

### Put Credit Spread (2026-06-18)
**Strategy:** Sell $1040.0 / Buy $1030.0
**Est. Credit:** $485.0 | **Max Risk:** $515.0
**Analysis:**
This Put Credit Spread strategy on LLY, targeting the long-term robustness of the stock while capitalizing on immediate technical exhaustion, presents a classic defined-risk setup. The core thesis is supported by the highly bullish long-term trend, evidenced by the significant separation of the SMA 50 ($965.01) above the SMA 200 ($817.95), suggesting strong structural demand and justifying the multi-year expiration date (2026-06-18). However, short-term momentum signals indicate the current price of $1071.64 is overextended; specifically, the Stochastic %K at 84.88 confirms the stock is heavily overbought, a state reinforced by the Bollinger Band %B reading of 0.69. Furthermore, the MACD histogram has signaled a slight bearish crossover (Value 24.34 < Signal 24.91), hinting at an imminent consolidation or minor retracement. The tactical placement of the short $1040.00 put strike directly addresses this short-term volatility risk, establishing a meaningful buffer of approximately 3% below the current market price, allowing the position to weather any potential reversion to the mean spurred by the high momentum readings. The strategy offers an acceptable, albeit slightly negative, probability-adjusted risk/reward profile, where the $485.0 maximum potential profit is earned against a maximum risk of $515.0, a structure favored when the probability of the stock remaining above the short strike is extremely high over the long duration.

### Call Credit Spread (2026-06-18)
**Strategy:** Sell $1100.0 / Buy $1120.0
**Est. Credit:** $885.0 | **Max Risk:** $1115.0
**Analysis:**
This Call Credit Spread on LLY, positioned far out in the 2026-06-18 expiration cycle, is a quantitative bet predicated on the exhaustion of short-term upward momentum, despite a robust long-term technical structure. While the price is riding a strong secular uptrend (SMA50 at $965.01 well above SMA200 at $817.95), immediate indicators suggest the rally may consolidate or reverse mildly before breaching the $1100 short strike. Specifically, the highly aggressive 10-day Rate of Change (9.10%) combined with the extremely elevated Stochastic reading of 84.88 puts the underlying asset firmly near the upper range of recent price action, signaling potential for near-term mean reversion or a lateral pause. Critically, the MACD has executed a bearish crossover (Value $24.34 below Signal $24.91), providing a tangible short-term indicator of weakening upward impulse, supporting the thesis that the stock will struggle to break out past the $1100 resistance level required to threaten the short call leg. The high Bollinger Band %B (0.69) reinforces this notion of temporary high pricing. This structure yields an Estimated Max Profit of $885.0 against an Estimated Max Risk of $1115.0 (a 1.26:1 Risk/Reward ratio), implying that the required premium for accepting the risk associated with shorting calls against such a strong long-term trend results in a less favorable potential payoff per dollar risked, necessitating high confidence in the technical resistance holding through the extended duration of the contract. *This analysis is purely hypothetical and does not constitute investment advice.*
